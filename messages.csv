Hi Shaun,
I acknowledge your 22 Aug 2025 email and I’m happy to cooperate with Phase 1 (drying) on the scheduled dates.
To keep the works moving without disrupting day-to-day living for me and my roommate (I work nights and rest during the day), please confirm the following in writing:
    Accommodation: arranged and paid directly by the agency for the entire repair period (no out-of-pocket and no reimbursement later). Near-CBD, quiet for daytime rest, with a desk and internet.
    Work window (choose day-by-day; confirm ≥24h in advance)
    • If accommodation is provided that day: full window 08:00–16:00 AEST. I’ll be off-site.
    • If no accommodation that day: two short blocks 09:00–12:00 and 16:00–18:00 AEST; during 12:00–16:00 there should be no entry and no noisy/heat-generating equipment in the unit.
    Simple daily brief (non-technical): which areas to clear, whether I should be on/off-site and for roughly how long, any do’s/don’ts, when it’s safe to re-use the space, and a single on-site email contact.
    Utilities & cleanliness: agency covers additional power/water from the works; tidy daily; restore condition on completion.
    Tenancy & rent: temporary relocation is not a surrender. On any day accommodation isn’t provided as agreed, or the bedroom remains unusable, daily rent abatement applies for that day.
    Property damage: any damage/loss arising from the works is the agency/contractor’s responsibility; please confirm the remediation plan and timeframe in writing the same day it’s identified.
    No “no-access” & comms: no “no-access” or similar charges unless ordered by the Tribunal; email-only communication for records.
Please send the accommodation details (location/dates/terms), specify the daily time mode, and the simple brief by 30 Aug 2025, 17:00 AEST. Once confirmed, I’ll prepare the space and provide access as scheduled.
Kind regards,
Chawakorn Kamnuansil
Unit 1803/243 Franklin St, Melbourne 3000

    Hi Chawakorn & Podjana,
    Good afternoon and hope you are well.
    FIXD has scheduled the repair work and we have sent out the notice of entry accordingly – please refer to the attached.
    Repair works are required in the bedroom due to water ingress from the common property. Highrise Strata has appointed FIXD Trade Group to carry out these works.
    Phase 1 repairs – Drying process – are scheduled for:
    2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8 and 9 September 2025 (excluding Sunday, 7 September 2025).
    This timeframe can vary, taking either less or more days depending on drying times. Once it has been confirmed that the drying has been completed, Phase 2 (rectification) will then begin. At that stage, FIXD will be able to provide an estimate of works once they have fully assessed the damage.
    Access will be needed from 8:00am on these dates, though the exact times may vary from day to day depending on how the works are progressing, drying times, and other factors that can’t be predicted in advance. FIXD will keep you updated as the works move along and will communicate with you about timings so you’re aware.
    We thank you in advance for your cooperation and will have these works completed as quickly as possible.

Dear Chawakorn,
 
Thank you for your recent email. I understand this has been a frustrating and challenging situation, and I appreciate you taking the time to outline your position.
 
The damage to the bedroom has resulted from a leak originating from common property. Responsibility for repairing both the source of the leak and the resultant damage lies with the party responsible — in this case, the Owners Corporation. They have taken steps to arrange the necessary works and have offered $800 in compensation to reflect the inconvenience caused to date.
 
Despite multiple written requests and the issuing of a formal Notice of Entry, access to the property has not yet been provided. We understand you may have concerns, but the works are essential, and the Owners Corporation has been actively trying to resolve the issue. We are currently waiting on a revised date from their trades. Once confirmed, a new Notice of Entry will be issued. On that date, both the agent and trades will attend to carry out the works. If access is again refused, we will proceed with an application to VCAT for a compliance order.
 
Our preference is to cooperate with you to ensure the repairs can proceed on the earliest available date. The sooner access is granted, the sooner this matter can be resolved.
 
We remain open to working with you constructively. During the VCAT hearing, the Tribunal member noted that staying in the second bedroom or the lounge room during the repair period would be a reasonable short-term arrangement. While we understand the second bedroom is currently occupied by the other tenant and this may not be ideal, it remains a temporary option to consider. If that arrangement isn’t workable, the option to end the lease early without penalty remains available.
 
In regard to your proposal, we do not agree to the requested $10,000 lump sum or a 24-month rent freeze. These terms are not proportionate, particularly given that access for repairs has not yet been provided. Any future compensation claim would also be assessed in light of whether reasonable steps were taken to mitigate loss. In this case, the matter could have been resolved some time ago had access been granted.
 
We’ll be in touch again once the repair date is confirmed. In the meantime, we ask that you confirm your willingness to allow access on the upcoming date, so the matter can be finalised without further escalation.
 
 
Kind Regards,
	Jamie Ong

Subject: Without Prejudice — Franklin 1803: Settlement Terms (VCAT R2025/18589/00)
 
Without Prejudice · Subject to Contract · Save as to Costs
Please confirm acceptance by: 23 August 2025, 17:00 AEST
On acceptance, I will request a VCAT consent order.
Dear Jamie Ong,
VCAT has dismissed the possession application in R202518589/00. I propose the following to conclude this matter efficiently.
Proposed Terms
    Compensation: AUD 10,000 lump sum, payable by bank transfer (details on acceptance).
    Rent freeze: Rent fixed at $2,825/month for 24 months from the acceptance date.
    File management and internal actions:
        Within 7 days of acceptance, confirm in writing that:
        Sylvia Hao and Johnson Tan will no longer be involved.
        Appropriate internal actions have been taken.
        Documentary confirmation will be provided.
    Bond: Maintain/return in full with no deductions.
    Authority & escalation: See Leverage & Enforcement for authority and escalation requirements.
Leverage & Enforcement
    Time of the essence: Offer expires 23 August 2025, 17:00 AEST.
    Without prejudice — save as to costs: This correspondence may be relied upon as to costs.
    Authority warranty: The signatory warrants authority to bind the agency and rental provider. If authority is limited, escalate to the OIEC/Principal and confirm within 7 days.
    No re-filing: Following acceptance, no further possession action will be taken on the same facts or grounds as R202518589/00.
    Non-retaliation & file controls: No adverse action against the renters. Sylvia Hao and Johnson Tan are removed from any involvement. Confirm file annotations and handover.
    Default consequences: If the deadline passes without acceptance, I will proceed with: (i) a VCAT compensation application with costs and statutory penalty interest under the Penalty Interest Rates Act 1983 (Vic) at the applicable rate, (ii) a complaint to Consumer Affairs Victoria (EARS) and the Business Licensing Authority, and (iii) where applicable, a complaint to the Victorian Ombudsman.
    Confidentiality: Settlement terms to be recorded in a VCAT consent order or deed; confidentiality to the extent permitted by law.
If accepted, these terms will constitute a full and final settlement of the issues raised to date. I will ask VCAT to issue a consent order or strike out the case with a right to apply for reinstatement to ensure enforceability.
Financial Breakdown
Rent reduction baseline: 30% × $2,825 × ~4 months (16 Apr–14 Aug = 120 days) = $3,390.00
VCAT fee paid: $74.10
Post-order rolling abatement (from 15 Aug): $27.85/day* until repair completion & handover
*Calculation: (2,825 × 12 × 30%) / 365 ≈ $27.85/day.
Payment On acceptance, request my EFT details by emailing ck.chawakorn@gmail.com. Cheque or PayID is also acceptable.
Acceptance Instructions
    Email subject: ACCEPTED — Franklin 1803 Settlement
    Body: “Accepted as proposed. Please provide EFT details.”
    Target transfer date: within 3 business days of acceptance.
This proposal is made on a commercial basis, without admission of liability by either party, and is without prejudice and subject to contract.
Reference: Attachment C — Johnson email, 9 Jul 2025.
I am keen to continue the tenancy on a positive footing.

Your safety and the condition of your home are our top priorities. Below are the procedures for reporting urgent repairs and emergency maintenance:

    The property does not meet minimum standards
    A safety-related device, such as a smoke alarm or pool fence, is not working

    Any fault or damage in the property that makes it unsafe or insecure, including pests, mould or damp caused by or related to the building structure

    Reason for urgency
    If the tradesperson you contacted could not resolve the problem over the phone
    Events leading up to the urgent call
    Photos and/or video documentation of the issue
    The name of the company you arranged, and if you arranged a trade not on our list, please provide their contact details

We appreciate your cooperation in promptly reporting any issues so we can address them effectively. 
 
Please Note: If a tradesperson visits and finds no faults, determines that the issue resulted from user error, or the maintenance is of a non-urgent nature, the renter may be responsible for the associated costs.

Dear Chawakorn Kamnuansil and Podjana Tienmon,
I hope you are both well.
Please find attached a copy of the VCAT order dated 21 July 2025 (Ref: R2025/18214/00) regarding your recent application.
As noted in the order, the Tribunal has suggested that if both parties can agree, a temporary relocation for approximately 14 days would allow the necessary repairs to be carried out at the property. Following the completion of these works, you would be able to return and resume your tenancy.
In line with this recommendation, we would like to offer you the opportunity to temporarily vacate the property for a 14-day period so repairs can proceed without delay. We are happy to coordinate dates and details with you to minimise disruption.
Please let us know your availability or any questions you may have.
Kind regards,
Sylvia Hao

Dear Chawakorn Kamnuansil and Podjana Tienmon,
I hope you are both well.
As previously communicated, we issued a Notice to Vacate requiring the return of keys by 14 July 2025. As the keys have not been returned and possession of the property has not been granted, we have now submitted a VCAT application (Ref: R202518589/00) to request possession of the premises, in accordance with the owner's instructions.
Please find attached the VCAT application form and a copy of the Notice to Vacate for your reference.
Should you have any questions or wish to discuss this matter, feel free to contact me.
Kind regards,
Sylvia Hao

This is an automated email. To contact VCAT email renting@courts.vic.gov.au or phone 1300 01 8228 (1300 01 VCAT)
How do I submit my evidence to VCAT for the hearing?
You will receive an email from VCAT which includes a link enabling you to upload your documents directly to VCAT's portal for the member to view – the email will be titled: ‘VCAT evidence link’ and will include the case file number and rented premises address.
You must submit your evidence at least 3 days prior to your hearing. (This may be sooner for urgent cases.)
Click the link to upload and submit your evidence. Ensure you have shared these files with the other party. Do not submit any other information using this link.
If you have multiple cases in progress, they will each have a separate upload link.
The link is active for 6 months from the date it is sent to you. If the case is still active after 6 months, you will require a new link. 
If you are attending a hearing in person at one of our VCAT venues, you must also bring a paper copy of all your documents to the hearing for the Member. If you have not provided VCAT with an email address, please contact us immediately on renting@courts.vic.gov.au to advise of your email address and ask for your evidence link.
If you do not have a copy of the link, please email renting@courts.vic.gov.au
How to send and access evidence in a residential tenancy case | VCAT
Estimated time to VCAT
We prioritise cases that the renting laws say must be heard within a certain time, and those we consider urgent. For example, urgent repairs are heard within 2 business days, and applications involving personal or family violence are heard within 3 business days. It takes about 7 business days to hear cases about non-urgent repairs. Applications for possession due to danger, damage, or disruption are scheduled for hearing as soon as possible within 4-6 weeks. Possession applications due to unpaid rent are heard in about 6 weeks, and most other applications for possession and renewals are heard within 8-10 weeks.
For applications considered urgent under the law, we contact you by text, phone or email within 24-48 hours. At an urgent hearing, only the urgent issues will be dealt with. Non-urgent issues, such as compensation, will be dealt with when there is more time at a later hearing.
Applications for re-opening (request for a review)
If you have submitted a review of an order that allows the Residential Rental Provider (Landlord) to purchase a Warrant of Possession, VCAT will not issue the Warrant until the review hearing is heard.
If the Warrant has been issued before the review request was made, VCAT will make an order placing the Warrant on hold until the review hearing is heard. If the Warrant is being executed within 48 hours, you must contact our customer service team on 1300 01 8228 (1300 01 VCAT) and alert us to your request.
If the Warrant is executed before an order is made placing the Warrant on hold, this cannot be reversed.
A copy of this order is sent to all parties and the Police identified on the Warrant.
If you or the Police have not received a copy of this order, please contact our customer service team on 1300 01 8228 (1300 01 VCAT)
If you are being evicted
Act now to seek help with alternative housing or get advice on your legal rights. If your rental provider has a warrant of possession from VCAT, the police can make you leave the property. The police will tell you when you need to leave, this may be immediately or they may return (usually within 14 days).
If you need help with crisis or emergency housing call 1800 825 955. This is a 24-hour, state-wide, toll-free service.
VCAT cannot provide legal advice but there are service providers who can give legal advice or information free or low cost
If you need someone to talk to, call Lifeline 13 11 14. This is a 24-hour Crisis Support service.

Dear Chawakorn,
You have recently been issued a notice to vacate by the property owner, with a required move-out date of 14/07/2025.
To facilitate a smooth and efficient vacating process, we kindly ask you to carefully review and follow the instructions provided below.
 
Final Payments:
Your rental status is currently paid to the 22/07/2025 with $0.00 on account.
A payment of $0.00 is due and payable prior to you vacating the property for the period up to the 14/07/2025.
 
Where to return keys: Please return keys & a copy of any cleaning receipts to our office at 33 Camberwell Road, Hawthorn East Vic 3123 between office hours. We are open Monday to Friday between 8.30am – 5.30pm during office hours. Please note, that if keys are not returned on or before the vacate date, rent will continue to be charged at the daily rate.
 
Power Connection: We recommend keeping the power connected for three business days after you return your keys. This will allow the final inspection to be completed with the power on. If the power is disconnected, we will need to establish a new connection, which may delay the bond return.
 
Final Inspection: We will conduct a final inspection of the property within 3 business days of the keys being returned. You are invited to attend the final inspection. If you would like to attend, please let me know ASAP so I can arrange a suitable time with you.
 
Bond Return: To ensure a speedy return of your bond, please return the property in its original condition, less normal wear and tear. You can expect your bond to be returned within 10 business days. For clarity on property expectations and to expedite the bond return process, please refer to the attached “Move out guide & tips to get your bond back.”
 
Utility Cancelation: Ensure that you contact all your utility providers to advise your intended vacate date. Any bills or charges incurred after your vacate date will be your responsibility.
 
Cleaning: We kindly ask that you leave the property in a clean and tidy state, as outlined in the rental agreement & as per the in-going condition report. To assist with the cleaning process, we have attached the document labelled “Vacate cleaning guide’’ to help you or your preferred cleaner.
 
Keys and Property Access: Please ensure that all keys, remotes, and other access devices provided to you are returned to the office and signed back in by your vacate date. Any unreturned or lost items will need to be replaced at your expense. Do not leave keys in the letterbox due to the risk of theft. Renters are responsible for replacing locks and keys if they are stolen from the letterbox. 
If you have any questions or need clarification on any of the above points, please don't hesitate to reach out.

Dear Johnson, Sylvia, and Team,
    I am including Sylvia here, as she was notably quick to declare the $800 compensation as final before I had any real opportunity to respond or negotiate. Please provide a clear explanation in writing of how this figure was determined.
To avoid any misunderstanding by herself only (Sylvia), I must state plainly that I do not accept or acknowledge this amount as adequate or final.
Screenshot 2025-07-11 at 11.44.53.png
Regarding your comment about resolving this matter “as quickly and smoothly as possible,” I am referring to the five Notices of Entry delivered within two days, followed by no one attending any of them. Please provide written evidence from FIXD explaining why these appointments were cancelled or ignored.
On the repeated suggestions to terminate my lease early without penalty, why is your agency so determined to propose ending a tenancy I have maintained responsibly? If this is effectively an admission that you cannot fulfill your obligations, stating that openly would be more professional.
Regarding involving the Owners Corporation: I am aware you would prefer not to accept sole accountability. However, I do not have any dispute with the OC. It appears the delays have mainly resulted from your own processes.If you believe involving the OC is necessary, please share their contact details, as I am considering contacting them directly to discuss whether we should explore a joint complaint regarding your handling of this matter.
For the avoidance of doubt, I expect written, itemised clarification of the following:
    How the $800 figure was calculated.
    What this amount is intended to cover.
    Evidence explaining the missed appointments.
    The reasons for repeated lease termination proposals.
I will be collecting all relevant records before deciding whether escalation is appropriate.
I trust you will address these points clearly and in writing, without further delay.
Sincerely,
Chawakorn Kamnuansil

    Hi Chawakorn,
     
    Good evening and hope you're both doing well.
    I’m following up on my previous email regarding the compensation from the OC.
     
    Please know that I’m here to assist and help explore the best possible options for you.
    At the end of the day, our shared goal is to have the issue resolved as quickly and smoothly as possible.
     
    I completely understand your concerns about staying in the property during the repair work.
    When FIXD inspected the property back in May, the initial estimate for the job duration was over 7 – 10 days.
    However, due to the delays, the condition might have been deteriorated. Hence, FIXD is unable to provide a timeframe of the work.
     
    As I have not yet received a confirmed response from the OC regarding the $800 compensation offer, I would like to outline some options for you to consider:
     
        Seek temporary accommodation during the works, and submit a reimbursement claim to the OC, who is ultimately responsible for the leak. While this is a valid option, I must note that we cannot guarantee the outcome of their approval.
        Early lease termination without penalty. If you feel the property will be uninhabitable during the repairs and would prefer not to take the risk of seeking compensation from the OC, the rental provider is willing to allow you to break the fixed-term lease early with no penalties.
        If you would like to further escalate this, you can have the OC joined as a party to residential tenancy application at VCAT
     
    Please let us know which option you would prefer, or if there’s anything else we can do to support you.
    Thank you again, and wishing you a pleasant evening.

    Hi Chawakorn,
     
    Thank you for your email.
    I would like to seek clarification on one thing, which I haven’t received a certain answer yet.
     
    I can see that there is a $800 compensation, offered by the OC.
    Is that compensation amount meant to be compensating the inconvenience during the work?
     
    If so, I believe that is the reason why the OC didn’t offer an alternative accommodation for this job.
    If no, can you please forward the email of you rejecting that offer?
     
    Thank you Chawakorn.

    Resending this—just to be sure it doesn’t get lost in whichever account you feel like using today.
    Consider it a polite note that swapping signatures and email headers doesn’t erase what’s actually happened here, or who is responsible.

        Dear Johnson,
        For clarity and to avoid further confusion:
        Where, precisely, are we expected to sleep while industrial dryers operate in our only bedroom?
        For how many days? What specific arrangements have you made to ensure we are not left without habitable space?
        Let’s be absolutely clear: I never confirmed anything. There is no message in which I agreed—because none exists.
        It is remarkable that after over two months of delay, the only certainty you can offer is the threat of charges if access is denied—yet you remain unable to answer the most basic question about where your tenants will live.
        If Sylvia chose to claim “confirmation” on my behalf, perhaps the cost of this entire situation belongs with her, not me.
        I look forward to seeing whether you can provide an actual plan rather than more excuses.

                This email is a formal response to the multiple, legally defective 'Notice to Renter' documents issued by Areal Property. It outlines your non-compliance and contains a final demand for action.
                Let us first establish the facts, based entirely on your own actions and documentation:
                    Your Notices Are Invalid: You deliberately marked ""NO"" on your own forms, formally declaring no details were attached. This renders them defective under the RTA.
                    You Have Fabricated Evidence: You have repeatedly relied on a non-existent ""tenant-confirmation"" to support your false narrative.
                    Abdication of Professional Duty: Your notice directs me to seek help from Consumer Affairs Victoria. This is a formal admission of your failure to perform your duties as an agent, attempting to outsource your responsibilities to me.
                After 70+ days of this conduct, the direct result of your failures is that one simple, fundamental question remains unanswered. The proposed work is in our only bedroom. Sylvia's unprofessional suggestion to ""stay at a friend's place"" is not a solution.
                Therefore, a singular, fundamental question requires your immediate attention:
                Where, precisely, are my roommate and I supposed to live while our bedroom is a work site?
                To be clear, any refusal of entry based on an unworkable or unreasonable plan—similar to the unhelpful suggestions you have provided in the past—will not be considered a breach on my part. The responsibility to provide a viable, respectful solution rests entirely with you. Consider this carefully.
                I require your clear, written plan for suitable temporary accommodation by 5:00 PM tomorrow, 4 July 2025.
                If you fail to provide this plan by the deadline, I will, without further notice, file an urgent application with VCAT and a formal complaint with Consumer Affairs Victoria. The complaint will detail the entire pattern of conduct outlined in this email, including your issuance of defective legal documents, fabrication of evidence, and abdication of professional duties.
                Your own documents will form the basis of my submissions.

Hi Chawakorn,
 
Good evening and hope you're both doing well.
I’m following up on my previous email regarding the compensation from the OC.
 
Please know that I’m here to assist and help explore the best possible options for you.
At the end of the day, our shared goal is to have the issue resolved as quickly and smoothly as possible.
 
I completely understand your concerns about staying in the property during the repair work.
When FIXD inspected the property back in May, the initial estimate for the job duration was over 7 – 10 days.
However, due to the delays, the condition might have been deteriorated. Hence, FIXD is unable to provide a timeframe of the work.
 
As I have not yet received a confirmed response from the OC regarding the $800 compensation offer, I would like to outline some options for you to consider:
 
    Seek temporary accommodation during the works, and submit a reimbursement claim to the OC, who is ultimately responsible for the leak. While this is a valid option, I must note that we cannot guarantee the outcome of their approval.
    Early lease termination without penalty. If you feel the property will be uninhabitable during the repairs and would prefer not to take the risk of seeking compensation from the OC, the rental provider is willing to allow you to break the fixed-term lease early with no penalties.
    If you would like to further escalate this, you can have the OC joined as a party to residential tenancy application at VCAT
 
Please let us know which option you would prefer, or if there’s anything else we can do to support you.
Thank you again, and wishing you a pleasant evening.
 
Kind Regards,
	Johnson Tan

Hi Chawakorn,
 
Thank you for your email.
I would like to seek clarification on one thing, which I haven’t received a certain answer yet.
 
I can see that there is a $800 compensation, offered by the OC.
Is that compensation amount meant to be compensating the inconvenience during the work?
 
If so, I believe that is the reason why the OC didn’t offer an alternative accommodation for this job.
If no, can you please forward the email of you rejecting that offer?
 
Thank you Chawakorn.

Resending this—just to be sure it doesn’t get lost in whichever account you feel like using today.
Consider it a polite note that swapping signatures and email headers doesn’t erase what’s actually happened here, or who is responsible.

    For how many days? What specific arrangements have you made to ensure we are not left without habitable space?
    Let’s be absolutely clear: I never confirmed anything. There is no message in which I agreed—because none exists.
    It is remarkable that after over two months of delay, the only certainty you can offer is the threat of charges if access is denied—yet you remain unable to answer the most basic question about where your tenants will live.
    If Sylvia chose to claim “confirmation” on my behalf, perhaps the cost of this entire situation belongs with her, not me.
    I look forward to seeing whether you can provide an actual plan rather than more excuses.

Hi Johnson,
Resending this—just to be sure it doesn’t get lost in whichever account you feel like using today.
Consider it a polite note that swapping signatures and email headers doesn’t erase what’s actually happened here, or who is responsible.
Regards,
Chawakorn

    Let’s be absolutely clear: I never confirmed anything. There is no message in which I agreed—because none exists.
    It is remarkable that after over two months of delay, the only certainty you can offer is the threat of charges if access is denied—yet you remain unable to answer the most basic question about where your tenants will live.
    If Sylvia chose to claim “confirmation” on my behalf, perhaps the cost of this entire situation belongs with her, not me.
    I look forward to seeing whether you can provide an actual plan rather than more excuses.

            To Johnson,
            This email is a formal response to the multiple, legally defective 'Notice to Renter' documents issued by Areal Property. It outlines your non-compliance and contains a final demand for action.
            Let us first establish the facts, based entirely on your own actions and documentation:
                Your Notices Are Invalid: You deliberately marked ""NO"" on your own forms, formally declaring no details were attached. This renders them defective under the RTA.
                You Have Fabricated Evidence: You have repeatedly relied on a non-existent ""tenant-confirmation"" to support your false narrative.
                Abdication of Professional Duty: Your notice directs me to seek help from Consumer Affairs Victoria. This is a formal admission of your failure to perform your duties as an agent, attempting to outsource your responsibilities to me.
            After 70+ days of this conduct, the direct result of your failures is that one simple, fundamental question remains unanswered. The proposed work is in our only bedroom. Sylvia's unprofessional suggestion to ""stay at a friend's place"" is not a solution.
            Therefore, a singular, fundamental question requires your immediate attention:
            Where, precisely, are my roommate and I supposed to live while our bedroom is a work site?
            To be clear, any refusal of entry based on an unworkable or unreasonable plan—similar to the unhelpful suggestions you have provided in the past—will not be considered a breach on my part. The responsibility to provide a viable, respectful solution rests entirely with you. Consider this carefully.
            I require your clear, written plan for suitable temporary accommodation by 5:00 PM tomorrow, 4 July 2025.
            If you fail to provide this plan by the deadline, I will, without further notice, file an urgent application with VCAT and a formal complaint with Consumer Affairs Victoria. The complaint will detail the entire pattern of conduct outlined in this email, including your issuance of defective legal documents, fabrication of evidence, and abdication of professional duties.
            Your own documents will form the basis of my submissions.

Dear Johnson,
For clarity and to avoid further confusion:
Where, precisely, are we expected to sleep while industrial dryers operate in our only bedroom?
For how many days? What specific arrangements have you made to ensure we are not left without habitable space?
Let’s be absolutely clear: I never confirmed anything. There is no message in which I agreed—because none exists.
It is remarkable that after over two months of delay, the only certainty you can offer is the threat of charges if access is denied—yet you remain unable to answer the most basic question about where your tenants will live.
If Sylvia chose to claim “confirmation” on my behalf, perhaps the cost of this entire situation belongs with her, not me.

Hi Matthew,
 
We would like to bring to your attention that over the past few weeks, we have made every reasonable effort to coordinate with the Owners Corporation (OC) and the appointed contractor, FIXD, to facilitate essential repair works at the property. This is now our second attempt to proceed with the repairs. To clarify, all relevant parties – including the OC, FIXD, our agency as the managing agent, and the rental provider are fully committed to commencing and completing the necessary repairs as promptly as possible.
We are more than willing to provide any further information the renter may reasonably request to facilitate cooperation. However, we respectfully request that VCAT take into account that we are NOT the party impeding progress.
 
 
Hi Chawakorn,
 
Please refer to below response in blue, as I have communicated with FIXD prior to this email.
I will get the remaining requested details from FIXD, but I can’t guarantee that they will reply within 24 hours.
Given that coordinating this repair requires the involvement of multiple parties and significant resources, your cooperation is not only appreciated but essential to ensure the work can proceed without further delay.
Thank you.

Dear Johnson,
Your three Section-86 notices, lodged by registered post on 27 June 2025, seek entry at
08:00 AM on 7, 8 and 9 July—only **12 days’** lead time—and leave the “Details attached” box
unchecked.  Entry therefore remains conditional.
SEND WITHIN 24 HOURS
  1. Contractor legal name, licence number & 24-hour mobile – Pending FIXD’s reply
  2. Day-by-day work scope (rooms, tasks, time estimates) for the full 7-day schedule The first stage of the repair involves reducing the moisture levels in the affected bedroom, as outlined in the Notice of Entry. During this drying process, the contractor will require daily access to the room in order to monitor and record moisture readings. At this stage, they are unable to provide specific time estimates for this phase, as the duration will depend on how quickly acceptable moisture levels are reached. Once the area has dried sufficiently, they will proceed with the necessary repair work. Please note that because the contractor has not yet assessed the current site conditions in full, they are unable to provide a definitive timeline or scope for the repairs at this time.
  3. Risk statement – water / power interruptions & noise levels - Pending FIXD’s reply
  4. Public-liability / PI insurance certificate - Pending FIXD’s reply
  5. “Tax invoice.pdf” **and** the alleged “tenant-confirmation” screenshot FIXD has been engaged by the Owners Corporation, as the source of the leak originates from a common area. The OC will cover the cost of the repairs once the work is completed. At this stage, FIXD is unable to provide a quote, as they have not yet been able to assess the current site conditions in detail. Could you please clarify what you mean by a “tenant-confirmation screenshot”?
  6. Daily-rate schedule for drying equipment **plus** written assurance that no
     “no-access” surcharge will be levied without a Tribunal order As previously mentioned, FIXD is the contractor appointed by the Owners Corporation (OC), and the OC will be covering the cost of the scheduled works. Could you please clarify the relevance of the “daily-rate schedule for drying equipment”? There will be no additional charges incurred, provided FIXD is granted access in accordance with the Notice of Entry and there are no delays caused by restricted access or obstruction to the repair process.
_No bundle → No entry → Call-out fee remains fictional._
**Provisional window (if items 1-6 arrive):** **Wed 9 Jul 2025, 15 : 30 – 19 : 00 AEST**
**Retaliatory warning** Your 27 Jun 15 : 09 email (“…deduct from your bond…”) breaches
s 264 RTA.  Any repeat—or any attempt to impose daily drying fees without prior disclosure—
will trigger my application for penalty units and costs.
**Non-confirmation notice** Until items 1-6 are supplied, this email does **not** constitute
consent.
Key verbatim excerpts for easy reference:
• *Exh A – 16 Jun 04 : 37 (tenant)* “any update … I’ll reply before 12 : 00 …”  
• *Exh B – 16 Jun 11 : 52 (agent)* “Thanks so much … **for confirming** …”  
• *Exh C – 23 Jun 14 : 35 (agent)* “remediation work … 24 Jun 08 : 30 … provide access …”  
• *Exh D – 27 Jun 15 : 09 (agent)* “**we will deduct it from your bond**.”  
Your own notices concede the job “might be extended subject to the length of the drying
process” yet provide no timeline or cost caps. Please resolve that conflict by supplying
items 1-6 above.

    Hi Chawakorn & Matthew,
     
    Good afternoon and hope you all are well.
    Quick update, we have served 3 x notice of entry today via registered post (please refer to the files attached).
    FIXD will need access to the property at 8AM on 7 July 2025, and for the rest of the week as mentioned in the notice.
     
    This will be the first stage of remediation work, which is to treat the mould and bring the moisture level down.
    They might not need to be in the property for the entire 9 hours in the first few days, but they will need access to check the moisture level in daily basis.
    Please be advised that if FIXD is unable to commence the work due to deny of access, the minimum labour charge applies and the cost will be forwarded to you.  
     
    Please let us know if you have any questions about this. Thank you.

    Hi Matthew & Chawakorn,
     
    Good morning and hope you are well.
    I have received the reply from FIXD Trade Group – contractor appointed by the OC for the repair.
    I have asked for the project timeline, and below is the reply:
     
    Please see below extract from our scope of works sent to Highrise Strata. 
     
    The drying process is essential for ensuring all affected building materials return to pre-loss moisture levels. However, the length of drying time may vary depending on external factors such as weather conditions and moisture content. FIXD is not responsible for delays in drying due to uncontrollable factors. Monitoring will be conducted daily, and any necessary adjustments/cost variations will be communicated promptly. FIXD will not be held responsible for any pre-existing conditions discovered during the course of remediation, including but not limited to structural defects, non-compliant installations, or prior water damage. Any discoveries will be communicated to the insured, and additional works may be required outside the scope of this project.
    We cannot provide a timeline as per your request due to the existing site constraints and nature of the damages. 
    Please note, once drying equipment is on-site, it is charged per day. If access is not provided as required by our team, extra charges may be applicable to the renters for not providing access. 
     
    Hi Chawakorn,
    Since no access was given on 24 June 2025, the contractor has sent us the attached invoice.
    Please advise whether you would like to pay them directly.
    Otherwise, the OC will settle with FIXD and on-charge the amount to Lot 1803A, and the rental provider will be seeking reimbursement from you.
    Please advise, thank you.

    Hi Matthew,
     
    Thank you for your call earlier.
    I have confirmed with the contractor from FIXD Trade Group, the work is now scheduled for 7 July 2025.
    This is the exact same job scope, which was scheduled for 24 June 2025, but no access was granted that day.
     
    The work consists of few stages, and the trade will not be able to send me the timeline until he is back to the office tomorrow.
    On 7 July 2025, the work will be mould remediation, which is to bring the moisture level in the affected bedroom down.
    Once the moisture level is at the appropriate level, the damage rectification job will be commenced (wall repair & etc).
    FIXD Trade Group will need multiple entries for the entire repair work.  
     
    Once I have received the timeline from them, I will forward it across so that we are all on the same page.
     
    If you need any further details, please feel free to reach out, thanks!

    Dear Matthew,
    I just received your email about closing my case and I'm quite confused. I thought getting a repair date was just the beginning of solving my problems, not the end.
    **The key issues I still need help with are:**
    - Compensation for 70+ days of paying full rent for an unusable bedroom
    - Where to stay during repairs (the agency hasn't provided any solution for this yet)
    - This has now affected my studies - my college contacted me this week about urgent matters
    **I don't understand - does getting a repair date mean I can't ask about these other problems anymore?**
    Thank you so much for arranging the July 7th repair after you contacted them. It's amazing they could suddenly arrange it after saying they needed 6-7 business days when I was asking, and I'd already waited over two months.
    I also wanted to mention that I haven't been able to confirm access for the repairs yet because the agency hasn't answered any of my previous questions about what exactly will happen during the repairs or what solutions they'll provide. From what I understand, my flatmate and I will need to leave our rooms during the work, which is quite a big decision that affects both our daily lives directly. I don't think it makes sense for me to confirm anything when I haven't received any information about the details or arrangements.
    I'm very sorry if I'm completely misunderstanding how this process works. As an international student who has never dealt with anything like this before, I realize I probably don't understand what VCAT can and cannot help with. I was hoping you might be able to guide me about what's reasonable to expect, but I understand if I'm asking for things that aren't part of your role.
    Should I just accept whatever happens with the repairs and forget about the past 70+ days and other problems? I don't want to cause trouble, but it doesn't feel right to just forget everything that happened.
    I'm quite overwhelmed and honestly don't know what to do about the compensation and accommodation issues. Could you please help me understand if there are options to address these concerns even if the repairs get scheduled?
    I hope it's okay to communicate in writing as phone conversations are difficult for me with serious matters. I don't have friends or family here who understand these problems, so I'm trying to figure everything out alone.
    Thank you for your patience with me.
    Thank you,
    Chawakorn Kamnuansil

        Thank you for your email.
        I have spoken with them yesterday morning and they have advised that due to their tight schedule, they will have to look into their booking and let us know when is the next available date.
        The contractor advised that the next available date should be within the next 6-7 business days.
        Since I haven’t received any confirmation, I have just sent another email to the OC and the contractor, asking them to provide a date & time.
        I will let you know once I have heard back from them.

        If not I will need to progress this matter to a hearing due to timeframes required to list urgent repair applications.

Dear Johnson,
Your three Section-86 notices, lodged by registered post on 27 June 2025, seek entry at
08:00 AM on 7, 8 and 9 July—only **12 days’** lead time—and leave the “Details attached” box
unchecked.  Entry therefore remains conditional.
SEND WITHIN 24 HOURS
  1. Contractor legal name, licence number & 24-hour mobile – Pending FIXD’s reply
  2. Day-by-day work scope (rooms, tasks, time estimates) for the full 7-day schedule The first stage of the repair involves reducing the moisture levels in the affected bedroom, as outlined in the Notice of Entry. During this drying process, the contractor will require daily access to the room in order to monitor and record moisture readings. At this stage, they are unable to provide specific time estimates for this phase, as the duration will depend on how quickly acceptable moisture levels are reached. Once the area has dried sufficiently, they will proceed with the necessary repair work. Please note that because the contractor has not yet assessed the current site conditions in full, they are unable to provide a definitive timeline or scope for the repairs at this time.
  3. Risk statement – water / power interruptions & noise levels - Pending FIXD’s reply
  4. Public-liability / PI insurance certificate - Pending FIXD’s reply
  5. “Tax invoice.pdf” **and** the alleged “tenant-confirmation” screenshot FIXD has been engaged by the Owners Corporation, as the source of the leak originates from a common area. The OC will cover the cost of the repairs once the work is completed. At this stage, FIXD is unable to provide a quote, as they have not yet been able to assess the current site conditions in detail. Could you please clarify what you mean by a “tenant-confirmation screenshot”?
  6. Daily-rate schedule for drying equipment **plus** written assurance that no
     “no-access” surcharge will be levied without a Tribunal order As previously mentioned, FIXD is the contractor appointed by the Owners Corporation (OC), and the OC will be covering the cost of the scheduled works. Could you please clarify the relevance of the “daily-rate schedule for drying equipment”? There will be no additional charges incurred, provided FIXD is granted access in accordance with the Notice of Entry and there are no delays caused by restricted access or obstruction to the repair process.

    Hi Matthew & Chawakorn,
     
    Good morning and hope you are well.
    I have received the reply from FIXD Trade Group – contractor appointed by the OC for the repair.
    I have asked for the project timeline, and below is the reply:
     
    Please see below extract from our scope of works sent to Highrise Strata. 
     
    The drying process is essential for ensuring all affected building materials return to pre-loss moisture levels. However, the length of drying time may vary depending on external factors such as weather conditions and moisture content. FIXD is not responsible for delays in drying due to uncontrollable factors. Monitoring will be conducted daily, and any necessary adjustments/cost variations will be communicated promptly. FIXD will not be held responsible for any pre-existing conditions discovered during the course of remediation, including but not limited to structural defects, non-compliant installations, or prior water damage. Any discoveries will be communicated to the insured, and additional works may be required outside the scope of this project.
    We cannot provide a timeline as per your request due to the existing site constraints and nature of the damages. 
    Please note, once drying equipment is on-site, it is charged per day. If access is not provided as required by our team, extra charges may be applicable to the renters for not providing access. 
     
    Hi Chawakorn,
    Since no access was given on 24 June 2025, the contractor has sent us the attached invoice.
    Please advise whether you would like to pay them directly.
    Otherwise, the OC will settle with FIXD and on-charge the amount to Lot 1803A, and the rental provider will be seeking reimbursement from you.
    Please advise, thank you.

    Hi Matthew,
     
    Thank you for your call earlier.
    I have confirmed with the contractor from FIXD Trade Group, the work is now scheduled for 7 July 2025.
    This is the exact same job scope, which was scheduled for 24 June 2025, but no access was granted that day.
     
    The work consists of few stages, and the trade will not be able to send me the timeline until he is back to the office tomorrow.
    On 7 July 2025, the work will be mould remediation, which is to bring the moisture level in the affected bedroom down.
    Once the moisture level is at the appropriate level, the damage rectification job will be commenced (wall repair & etc).
    FIXD Trade Group will need multiple entries for the entire repair work.  
     
    Once I have received the timeline from them, I will forward it across so that we are all on the same page.
     
    If you need any further details, please feel free to reach out, thanks!

    Dear Matthew,
    I just received your email about closing my case and I'm quite confused. I thought getting a repair date was just the beginning of solving my problems, not the end.
    **The key issues I still need help with are:**
    - Compensation for 70+ days of paying full rent for an unusable bedroom
    - Where to stay during repairs (the agency hasn't provided any solution for this yet)
    - This has now affected my studies - my college contacted me this week about urgent matters
    **I don't understand - does getting a repair date mean I can't ask about these other problems anymore?**
    Thank you so much for arranging the July 7th repair after you contacted them. It's amazing they could suddenly arrange it after saying they needed 6-7 business days when I was asking, and I'd already waited over two months.
    I also wanted to mention that I haven't been able to confirm access for the repairs yet because the agency hasn't answered any of my previous questions about what exactly will happen during the repairs or what solutions they'll provide. From what I understand, my flatmate and I will need to leave our rooms during the work, which is quite a big decision that affects both our daily lives directly. I don't think it makes sense for me to confirm anything when I haven't received any information about the details or arrangements.
    I'm very sorry if I'm completely misunderstanding how this process works. As an international student who has never dealt with anything like this before, I realize I probably don't understand what VCAT can and cannot help with. I was hoping you might be able to guide me about what's reasonable to expect, but I understand if I'm asking for things that aren't part of your role.
    Should I just accept whatever happens with the repairs and forget about the past 70+ days and other problems? I don't want to cause trouble, but it doesn't feel right to just forget everything that happened.
    I'm quite overwhelmed and honestly don't know what to do about the compensation and accommodation issues. Could you please help me understand if there are options to address these concerns even if the repairs get scheduled?
    I hope it's okay to communicate in writing as phone conversations are difficult for me with serious matters. I don't have friends or family here who understand these problems, so I'm trying to figure everything out alone.
    Thank you for your patience with me.
    Thank you,
    Chawakorn Kamnuansil

        Thank you for your email.
        I have spoken with them yesterday morning and they have advised that due to their tight schedule, they will have to look into their booking and let us know when is the next available date.
        The contractor advised that the next available date should be within the next 6-7 business days.
        Since I haven’t received any confirmation, I have just sent another email to the OC and the contractor, asking them to provide a date & time.

        Can you please confirm whether you are able to confirm a time that trades will be able to reattend the property. Could you please confirm this by close of business today.
         
        If not I will need to progress this matter to a hearing due to timeframes required to list urgent repair applications.
         
        If an agreement can be reached regarding a timeframe to resolve the repair issue this matter can be struck out with a right of reinstatement. I have included the renters in this email for reference.

    Hi Matthew & Chawakorn,
     
    Good morning and hope you are well.
    I have received the reply from FIXD Trade Group – contractor appointed by the OC for the repair.
    I have asked for the project timeline, and below is the reply:
     
    Please see below extract from our scope of works sent to Highrise Strata. 
     
    The drying process is essential for ensuring all affected building materials return to pre-loss moisture levels. However, the length of drying time may vary depending on external factors such as weather conditions and moisture content. FIXD is not responsible for delays in drying due to uncontrollable factors. Monitoring will be conducted daily, and any necessary adjustments/cost variations will be communicated promptly. FIXD will not be held responsible for any pre-existing conditions discovered during the course of remediation, including but not limited to structural defects, non-compliant installations, or prior water damage. Any discoveries will be communicated to the insured, and additional works may be required outside the scope of this project.
    We cannot provide a timeline as per your request due to the existing site constraints and nature of the damages. 
    Please note, once drying equipment is on-site, it is charged per day. If access is not provided as required by our team, extra charges may be applicable to the renters for not providing access. 
     
    Hi Chawakorn,
    Since no access was given on 24 June 2025, the contractor has sent us the attached invoice.
    Please advise whether you would like to pay them directly.
    Otherwise, the OC will settle with FIXD and on-charge the amount to Lot 1803A, and the rental provider will be seeking reimbursement from you.
    Please advise, thank you.

    Hi Matthew,
     
    Thank you for your call earlier.
    I have confirmed with the contractor from FIXD Trade Group, the work is now scheduled for 7 July 2025.
    This is the exact same job scope, which was scheduled for 24 June 2025, but no access was granted that day.
     
    The work consists of few stages, and the trade will not be able to send me the timeline until he is back to the office tomorrow.
    On 7 July 2025, the work will be mould remediation, which is to bring the moisture level in the affected bedroom down.
    Once the moisture level is at the appropriate level, the damage rectification job will be commenced (wall repair & etc).
    FIXD Trade Group will need multiple entries for the entire repair work.  
     
    Once I have received the timeline from them, I will forward it across so that we are all on the same page.
     
    If you need any further details, please feel free to reach out, thanks!

    Dear Matthew,
    I just received your email about closing my case and I'm quite confused. I thought getting a repair date was just the beginning of solving my problems, not the end.
    **The key issues I still need help with are:**
    - Compensation for 70+ days of paying full rent for an unusable bedroom
    - Where to stay during repairs (the agency hasn't provided any solution for this yet)
    - This has now affected my studies - my college contacted me this week about urgent matters
    **I don't understand - does getting a repair date mean I can't ask about these other problems anymore?**
    Thank you so much for arranging the July 7th repair after you contacted them. It's amazing they could suddenly arrange it after saying they needed 6-7 business days when I was asking, and I'd already waited over two months.
    I also wanted to mention that I haven't been able to confirm access for the repairs yet because the agency hasn't answered any of my previous questions about what exactly will happen during the repairs or what solutions they'll provide. From what I understand, my flatmate and I will need to leave our rooms during the work, which is quite a big decision that affects both our daily lives directly. I don't think it makes sense for me to confirm anything when I haven't received any information about the details or arrangements.
    I'm very sorry if I'm completely misunderstanding how this process works. As an international student who has never dealt with anything like this before, I realize I probably don't understand what VCAT can and cannot help with. I was hoping you might be able to guide me about what's reasonable to expect, but I understand if I'm asking for things that aren't part of your role.
    Should I just accept whatever happens with the repairs and forget about the past 70+ days and other problems? I don't want to cause trouble, but it doesn't feel right to just forget everything that happened.
    I'm quite overwhelmed and honestly don't know what to do about the compensation and accommodation issues. Could you please help me understand if there are options to address these concerns even if the repairs get scheduled?
    I hope it's okay to communicate in writing as phone conversations are difficult for me with serious matters. I don't have friends or family here who understand these problems, so I'm trying to figure everything out alone.
    Thank you for your patience with me.
    Thank you,
    Chawakorn Kamnuansil

        Hi Matthew,
        Thank you for your email.
        I have spoken with them yesterday morning and they have advised that due to their tight schedule, they will have to look into their booking and let us know when is the next available date.
        The contractor advised that the next available date should be within the next 6-7 business days.
        Since I haven’t received any confirmation, I have just sent another email to the OC and the contractor, asking them to provide a date & time.
        I will let you know once I have heard back from them.
         
        Thank you.

        Good afternoon Johnson
         
        Can you please confirm whether you are able to confirm a time that trades will be able to reattend the property. Could you please confirm this by close of business today.
         
        If not I will need to progress this matter to a hearing due to timeframes required to list urgent repair applications.
         
        If an agreement can be reached regarding a timeframe to resolve the repair issue this matter can be struck out with a right of reinstatement. I have included the renters in this email for reference.

Hi Chawakorn & Matthew,
 
Good afternoon and hope you all are well.
Quick update, we have served 3 x notice of entry today via registered post (please refer to the files attached).
FIXD will need access to the property at 8AM on 7 July 2025, and for the rest of the week as mentioned in the notice.
 
This will be the first stage of remediation work, which is to treat the mould and bring the moisture level down.
They might not need to be in the property for the entire 9 hours in the first few days, but they will need access to check the moisture level in daily basis.
Please be advised that if FIXD is unable to commence the work due to deny of access, the minimum labour charge applies and the cost will be forwarded to you.  
 
Please let us know if you have any questions about this. Thank you.
 
 
Kind Regards,

Hi Matthew & Chawakorn,
 
Good morning and hope you are well.
I have received the reply from FIXD Trade Group – contractor appointed by the OC for the repair.
I have asked for the project timeline, and below is the reply:
 
Please see below extract from our scope of works sent to Highrise Strata. 
 
The drying process is essential for ensuring all affected building materials return to pre-loss moisture levels. However, the length of drying time may vary depending on external factors such as weather conditions and moisture content. FIXD is not responsible for delays in drying due to uncontrollable factors. Monitoring will be conducted daily, and any necessary adjustments/cost variations will be communicated promptly. FIXD will not be held responsible for any pre-existing conditions discovered during the course of remediation, including but not limited to structural defects, non-compliant installations, or prior water damage. Any discoveries will be communicated to the insured, and additional works may be required outside the scope of this project.
We cannot provide a timeline as per your request due to the existing site constraints and nature of the damages. 
Please note, once drying equipment is on-site, it is charged per day. If access is not provided as required by our team, extra charges may be applicable to the renters for not providing access. 
 
Hi Chawakorn,
Since no access was given on 24 June 2025, the contractor has sent us the attached invoice.
Please advise whether you would like to pay them directly.
Otherwise, the OC will settle with FIXD and on-charge the amount to Lot 1803A, and the rental provider will be seeking reimbursement from you.
Please advise, thank you.

Hi Matthew,
 
Thank you for your call earlier.
I have confirmed with the contractor from FIXD Trade Group, the work is now scheduled for 7 July 2025.
This is the exact same job scope, which was scheduled for 24 June 2025, but no access was granted that day.
 
The work consists of few stages, and the trade will not be able to send me the timeline until he is back to the office tomorrow.
On 7 July 2025, the work will be mould remediation, which is to bring the moisture level in the affected bedroom down.
Once the moisture level is at the appropriate level, the damage rectification job will be commenced (wall repair & etc).
FIXD Trade Group will need multiple entries for the entire repair work.  
 
Once I have received the timeline from them, I will forward it across so that we are all on the same page.
 
If you need any further details, please feel free to reach out, thanks!

Dear Matthew,
I just received your email about closing my case and I'm quite confused. I thought getting a repair date was just the beginning of solving my problems, not the end.
**The key issues I still need help with are:**
- Compensation for 70+ days of paying full rent for an unusable bedroom
- Where to stay during repairs (the agency hasn't provided any solution for this yet)
- This has now affected my studies - my college contacted me this week about urgent matters
**I don't understand - does getting a repair date mean I can't ask about these other problems anymore?**
Thank you so much for arranging the July 7th repair after you contacted them. It's amazing they could suddenly arrange it after saying they needed 6-7 business days when I was asking, and I'd already waited over two months.
I also wanted to mention that I haven't been able to confirm access for the repairs yet because the agency hasn't answered any of my previous questions about what exactly will happen during the repairs or what solutions they'll provide. From what I understand, my flatmate and I will need to leave our rooms during the work, which is quite a big decision that affects both our daily lives directly. I don't think it makes sense for me to confirm anything when I haven't received any information about the details or arrangements.
I'm very sorry if I'm completely misunderstanding how this process works. As an international student who has never dealt with anything like this before, I realize I probably don't understand what VCAT can and cannot help with. I was hoping you might be able to guide me about what's reasonable to expect, but I understand if I'm asking for things that aren't part of your role.
Should I just accept whatever happens with the repairs and forget about the past 70+ days and other problems? I don't want to cause trouble, but it doesn't feel right to just forget everything that happened.
I'm quite overwhelmed and honestly don't know what to do about the compensation and accommodation issues. Could you please help me understand if there are options to address these concerns even if the repairs get scheduled?
I hope it's okay to communicate in writing as phone conversations are difficult for me with serious matters. I don't have friends or family here who understand these problems, so I'm trying to figure everything out alone.
Thank you for your patience with me.
Thank you,
Chawakorn Kamnuansil

    Can you please confirm whether you are able to confirm a time that trades will be able to reattend the property. Could you please confirm this by close of business today.
     
    If not I will need to progress this matter to a hearing due to timeframes required to list urgent repair applications.
     
    If an agreement can be reached regarding a timeframe to resolve the repair issue this matter can be struck out with a right of reinstatement. I have included the renters in this email for reference.

Good afternoon Chawakorn
 
Thank you for your email. I understand your application relates to urgent repairs and compensation.
 
The urgent repair component must be dealt with first as it is considered more urgent. If this matter progressed to a VCAT hearing only the urgent repairs would be considered in a first hearing.
 
As a resolution appears to have been reached regarding the repairs component I will proceed to strike this matter out with a right of reinstatement. 
 
What this means is if you wish to proceed with a compensation claim this would be dealt with at a later date. To do this you would request to reinstate your case using the attached form if the repairs were not completed as agreed or if you wish to pursue compensation once the repairs are completed.
 
If you wish to obtain legal advice or information you may wish to reach out to Tenants Victoria  https://tenantsvic.org.au/
 
Please let me know if you have any questions.

Matthew T.

    Good afternoon Johnson
     
    Can you please confirm whether you are able to confirm a time that trades will be able to reattend the property. Could you please confirm this by close of business today.
     
    If not I will need to progress this matter to a hearing due to timeframes required to list urgent repair applications.
     
    If an agreement can be reached regarding a timeframe to resolve the repair issue this matter can be struck out with a right of reinstatement. I have included the renters in this email for reference.

Hi Matthew & Chawakorn,
 
Good morning and hope you are well.
I have received the reply from FIXD Trade Group – contractor appointed by the OC for the repair.
I have asked for the project timeline, and below is the reply:
 
Please see below extract from our scope of works sent to Highrise Strata. 
 
The drying process is essential for ensuring all affected building materials return to pre-loss moisture levels. However, the length of drying time may vary depending on external factors such as weather conditions and moisture content. FIXD is not responsible for delays in drying due to uncontrollable factors. Monitoring will be conducted daily, and any necessary adjustments/cost variations will be communicated promptly. FIXD will not be held responsible for any pre-existing conditions discovered during the course of remediation, including but not limited to structural defects, non-compliant installations, or prior water damage. Any discoveries will be communicated to the insured, and additional works may be required outside the scope of this project.
We cannot provide a timeline as per your request due to the existing site constraints and nature of the damages. 
Please note, once drying equipment is on-site, it is charged per day. If access is not provided as required by our team, extra charges may be applicable to the renters for not providing access. 
 
Hi Chawakorn,
Since no access was given on 24 June 2025, the contractor has sent us the attached invoice.
Please advise whether you would like to pay them directly.
Otherwise, the OC will settle with FIXD and on-charge the amount to Lot 1803A, and the rental provider will be seeking reimbursement from you.
Please advise, thank you.
 
Kind Regards,

Hi Matthew,
 
Thank you for your call earlier.
I have confirmed with the contractor from FIXD Trade Group, the work is now scheduled for 7 July 2025.
This is the exact same job scope, which was scheduled for 24 June 2025, but no access was granted that day.
 
The work consists of few stages, and the trade will not be able to send me the timeline until he is back to the office tomorrow.
On 7 July 2025, the work will be mould remediation, which is to bring the moisture level in the affected bedroom down.
Once the moisture level is at the appropriate level, the damage rectification job will be commenced (wall repair & etc).
FIXD Trade Group will need multiple entries for the entire repair work.  
 
Once I have received the timeline from them, I will forward it across so that we are all on the same page.
 
If you need any further details, please feel free to reach out, thanks!

Dear Matthew,
I just received your email about closing my case and I'm quite confused. I thought getting a repair date was just the beginning of solving my problems, not the end.
**The key issues I still need help with are:**
- Compensation for 70+ days of paying full rent for an unusable bedroom
- Where to stay during repairs (the agency hasn't provided any solution for this yet)
- This has now affected my studies - my college contacted me this week about urgent matters
**I don't understand - does getting a repair date mean I can't ask about these other problems anymore?**
Thank you so much for arranging the July 7th repair after you contacted them. It's amazing they could suddenly arrange it after saying they needed 6-7 business days when I was asking, and I'd already waited over two months.
I also wanted to mention that I haven't been able to confirm access for the repairs yet because the agency hasn't answered any of my previous questions about what exactly will happen during the repairs or what solutions they'll provide. From what I understand, my flatmate and I will need to leave our rooms during the work, which is quite a big decision that affects both our daily lives directly. I don't think it makes sense for me to confirm anything when I haven't received any information about the details or arrangements.
I'm very sorry if I'm completely misunderstanding how this process works. As an international student who has never dealt with anything like this before, I realize I probably don't understand what VCAT can and cannot help with. I was hoping you might be able to guide me about what's reasonable to expect, but I understand if I'm asking for things that aren't part of your role.
Should I just accept whatever happens with the repairs and forget about the past 70+ days and other problems? I don't want to cause trouble, but it doesn't feel right to just forget everything that happened.
I'm quite overwhelmed and honestly don't know what to do about the compensation and accommodation issues. Could you please help me understand if there are options to address these concerns even if the repairs get scheduled?
I hope it's okay to communicate in writing as phone conversations are difficult for me with serious matters. I don't have friends or family here who understand these problems, so I'm trying to figure everything out alone.
Thank you for your patience with me.
Thank you,
Chawakorn Kamnuansil

    Thank you for your email.
    I have spoken with them yesterday morning and they have advised that due to their tight schedule, they will have to look into their booking and let us know when is the next available date.
    The contractor advised that the next available date should be within the next 6-7 business days.
    Since I haven’t received any confirmation, I have just sent another email to the OC and the contractor, asking them to provide a date & time.
    I will let you know once I have heard back from them.

    If not I will need to progress this matter to a hearing due to timeframes required to list urgent repair applications.
     
    If an agreement can be reached regarding a timeframe to resolve the repair issue this matter can be struck out with a right of reinstatement. I have included the renters in this email for reference.

Dear Matthew,
I just received your email about closing my case and I'm quite confused. I thought getting a repair date was just the beginning of solving my problems, not the end.
**The key issues I still need help with are:**
- Compensation for 70+ days of paying full rent for an unusable bedroom
- Where to stay during repairs (the agency hasn't provided any solution for this yet)
- This has now affected my studies - my college contacted me this week about urgent matters
**I don't understand - does getting a repair date mean I can't ask about these other problems anymore?**
Thank you so much for arranging the July 7th repair after you contacted them. It's amazing they could suddenly arrange it after saying they needed 6-7 business days when I was asking, and I'd already waited over two months.
I also wanted to mention that I haven't been able to confirm access for the repairs yet because the agency hasn't answered any of my previous questions about what exactly will happen during the repairs or what solutions they'll provide. From what I understand, my flatmate and I will need to leave our rooms during the work, which is quite a big decision that affects both our daily lives directly. I don't think it makes sense for me to confirm anything when I haven't received any information about the details or arrangements.
I'm very sorry if I'm completely misunderstanding how this process works. As an international student who has never dealt with anything like this before, I realize I probably don't understand what VCAT can and cannot help with. I was hoping you might be able to guide me about what's reasonable to expect, but I understand if I'm asking for things that aren't part of your role.
Should I just accept whatever happens with the repairs and forget about the past 70+ days and other problems? I don't want to cause trouble, but it doesn't feel right to just forget everything that happened.
I'm quite overwhelmed and honestly don't know what to do about the compensation and accommodation issues. Could you please help me understand if there are options to address these concerns even if the repairs get scheduled?
I hope it's okay to communicate in writing as phone conversations are difficult for me with serious matters. I don't have friends or family here who understand these problems, so I'm trying to figure everything out alone.
Thank you for your patience with me.
Thank you,
Chawakorn Kamnuansil

    Thank you for your email.
    I have spoken with them yesterday morning and they have advised that due to their tight schedule, they will have to look into their booking and let us know when is the next available date.
    The contractor advised that the next available date should be within the next 6-7 business days.
    Since I haven’t received any confirmation, I have just sent another email to the OC and the contractor, asking them to provide a date & time.
    I will let you know once I have heard back from them.

Good afternoon Johnson
 
Can you please confirm whether you are able to confirm a time that trades will be able to reattend the property. Could you please confirm this by close of business today.
 
If not I will need to progress this matter to a hearing due to timeframes required to list urgent repair applications.
 
If an agreement can be reached regarding a timeframe to resolve the repair issue this matter can be struck out with a right of reinstatement. I have included the renters in this email for reference.

Dear Johnson,
Thank you for your follow-up regarding events. I sincerely apologize for any inconvenience caused.
I want to clarify that I have never refused access for necessary repairs. The situation on 24 June occurred due to inadequate advance communication about the specific scheduling and requirements, which left me unprepared for the visit.
I genuinely regret that the contractor's time was affected, and I understand this may have caused complications for the scheduling process.
As this matter is now being handled through the formal dispute resolution process (Case RT252398), I believe all repair coordination should proceed through the official RDRV channel to ensure proper documentation and clarity for all parties moving forward.
I remain committed to resolving this matter constructively and cooperatively, and I look forward to working with the Resolution Coordinator to establish an appropriate process that works for everyone involved.
Thank you for your understanding, and I apologize again for yesterday's circumstances.
Regards,
Chawakorn Kamnuansil

    Hi Chawakon, 
    I hope you're both safe and well.
    I’ve just been informed by the contractor arranged by the Owners Corporation that they were unable to carry out the scheduled repair work this morning due to an access issue. They mentioned they rang both the intercom and your mobile but unfortunately couldn’t get through.
    After waiting for approximately an hour, they had no choice but to leave the building. As a result, they will need to charge the OC for the call-out and arrange a new time for the job to be completed.
    Our primary concern is to ensure everything is okay on your end, especially as we haven’t heard from you today. 
    Please let us know that you're safe when you get a moment, and we’ll work with the OC to coordinate a new appointment as soon as possible.

        Hi Chawakorn, 
        Thank you for your reply. I want to start by sincerely apologising for the inconvenience and frustration this ongoing issue has caused you. I truly understand how disruptive this must be, and I appreciate your continued patience throughout.
        After reviewing the communication trail, I want to clarify that the source of the leak originates from a common area of the building, which falls under the Owners Corporation's (OC) responsibility. As a result, all scheduling and repair works need to be coordinated through them. Unfortunately, this has contributed to the delays, and I understand how frustrating that can be.
        To address your first question: Sylvia did send an email on 18 June 2025 to both you and Podjana once the OC confirmed the appointment details. I’ve attached a screenshot of that email for your reference. It’s possible it was missed, but I’m glad to hear that you’ll be able to provide access tomorrow.
        Regarding alternative accommodation, it was my understanding that the agreed $800 compensation was intended to help offset those costs. If I’ve misunderstood or missed anything, please do let me know—there’s been a lot of emails, and I want to ensure nothing important is overlooked. The amount will be set as rent credit once the repair is commenced. 
        Again, I truly empathise with your situation. From what I’ve seen, Sylvia has been doing her utmost to keep communication flowing between all parties involved—yourself, the rental provider, the OC, and their plumber. Unfortunately, her ability to act is limited when the responsible party is not as responsive as we would hope.
        Please rest assured that we will continue to follow up closely and advocate for this to be resolved as quickly as possible.

            Dear Johnson,
            Thank you for your message. And honestly, I’m relieved to hear from someone new, because I don’t feel that Sylvia Hao ever fully understood what I’ve been trying to say from the start.
            Happy holiday to Sylvia — I hope she’s having a relaxing break. I wish I could take one too under the current circumstances.
            I kindly ask you to take a moment to review my past emails. At no point did I confirm that I agreed to the works or gave consent to proceed. In fact, I’ve repeatedly asked Sylvia for proper information and clarification, which I never received. The only thing I said was that I might be out of touch — which I clearly explained was because I needed a break from all this due to how much stress it had caused me. And now, after several days of silence, I suddenly receive a reminder that the works are happening tomorrow?
            I have no idea what’s going to happen to me tomorrow.
            You’re asking me to provide access for something I was never truly consulted on. I was not given 14 days’ notice. And more importantly — where do you actually expect me to stay? I just paid $2,825 in rent. I have no money for a second place. I can’t share a bedroom with my co-tenant. And no one from your office, including Sylvia, has ever addressed that properly.
            If this is the agency’s internal policy — to carry out major internal works while offering no accommodation or practical alternatives to the tenant — then please confirm that to me clearly. It would actually be helpful for me to have that confirmed, because I have now submitted this matter to VCAT and am preparing to provide a complete record of what’s happened.
            Again, I am not refusing access. I am simply asking a question that no one has answered: where am I supposed to stay?
            Also, please do not attempt to contact me by phone. I will not answer any calls. All communication must be in writing by email, as phone calls cannot be recorded or documented for evidence purposes.
            Regards,

                            I hope you're well, and thank you again for your continued engagement regarding the repair matter.
                            Following instructions from the rental provider, we are now arranging to proceed with the required repairs to the water-damaged wall and flooring. These works are necessary to prevent further deterioration of the property.
                            To ensure works can commence without further delay, please expect a formal Notice of Entry to be issued on Monday, 16 June 2025. This is in accordance with the Residential Tenancies Act and will confirm the entry date and time for the Owners Corporation’s contractors to attend.
                            As previously advised, the repair process is estimated to take approximately 7–12 days. If you have any preferred times or specific availability for the week ahead, please feel free to share this by 12:00 PM Monday, 16 June, and we’ll do our best to coordinate accordingly. However, please note that access must be provided to prevent further damage and comply with maintenance obligations.
                            In terms of rent compensation, a rent credit of $800 will be applied and reflected on your ledger. This offer has been confirmed by the rental provider as final, with no further compensation to be considered.
                            If you feel the current tenancy no longer suits your circumstances, the owner is open to discussing a mutual lease termination, without penalty, should you wish to explore that option.
                            Please don’t hesitate to reach out with any further questions or concerns — we remain committed to a timely and fair resolution.
                            Warm regards,

                                        Dear Sylvia,
                                        I’ve taken some time to reflect on the communication surrounding this matter — not just in the past few days, but throughout the entire process.
                                        The meeting times proposed in your recent email were sent without any acknowledgement of my previous proposal, no explanation for the lack of response to the 9:00 AM deadline I had clearly stated, and no apology for the time and preparation that were disregarded when your office failed to respond. That silence, in itself, said a great deal.
                                        In addition, the questions I have raised — including the breakdown of the $800 figure, the repair timeline, and the specific conditions affecting my tenancy — have still not been addressed in writing. These are matters that should be readily available to your team, and I find it concerning that they remain unanswered despite repeated and reasonable requests.
                                        I’ve done my best to remain cooperative, flexible, and patient, even though I am the one living with the ongoing impact. But based on the way this has been handled, I no longer believe that an in-person meeting will lead to any meaningful resolution — especially when my time and concerns have not been respected.
                                        Accordingly, I will not be attending any further meetings. From this point forward, I will only continue this matter through formal written communication. If that clarity is not provided, I will proceed with the appropriate next steps without further notice.
                                        I have made every effort to avoid escalation. If communication continues in this pattern, the matter will simply follow its natural course.
                                        Sincerely,
                                        Chawakorn Kamnuansil

Dear Matthew,
Thank you for your email regarding Case RT252398 at 33 Camberwell Rd, Hawthorn East.
I just want to share some information from my side to help you understand the situation more clearly. I'm an international student living in this unit, and I’m not very familiar with all the repair or legal processes in Melbourne, but I’m really trying to follow everything the right way.
Recently I heard that a contractor came, but I didn’t receive any clear message or schedule about what was going to happen. I didn’t know if they were coming just to check or to actually repair the problem. I also wasn’t told if I needed to leave the room or prepare anything. Because I live in the area that needs repair, this kind of information is really important for me to get ready properly.
To try my best, I stayed up the whole night before working on documents and preparing everything I thought might be useful for this case. I finished around 5 AM. I was trying to be responsible and respectful of the process. Unfortunately, I was so tired that I accidentally fell asleep in the morning and didn’t hear anything when the contractor came. It wasn’t on purpose, and I really didn’t mean to miss them.
I never refused access. I just didn’t get clear communication about the visit and couldn’t prepare for it properly. I still really want the repair to be done and I’m happy to reschedule, as long as I know in advance what will happen and what I need to do.
Please continue with the case. The problem hasn’t been fixed yet and I’m hoping we can move forward.
Kind regards,
Chawakorn Kamnuansil

Hi Chawakon, 
I hope you're both safe and well.
I’ve just been informed by the contractor arranged by the Owners Corporation that they were unable to carry out the scheduled repair work this morning due to an access issue. They mentioned they rang both the intercom and your mobile but unfortunately couldn’t get through.
After waiting for approximately an hour, they had no choice but to leave the building. As a result, they will need to charge the OC for the call-out and arrange a new time for the job to be completed.
Our primary concern is to ensure everything is okay on your end, especially as we haven’t heard from you today. 
Please let us know that you're safe when you get a moment, and we’ll work with the OC to coordinate a new appointment as soon as possible.

    Hi Chawakorn, 
    Thank you for your reply. I want to start by sincerely apologising for the inconvenience and frustration this ongoing issue has caused you. I truly understand how disruptive this must be, and I appreciate your continued patience throughout.
    After reviewing the communication trail, I want to clarify that the source of the leak originates from a common area of the building, which falls under the Owners Corporation's (OC) responsibility. As a result, all scheduling and repair works need to be coordinated through them. Unfortunately, this has contributed to the delays, and I understand how frustrating that can be.
    To address your first question: Sylvia did send an email on 18 June 2025 to both you and Podjana once the OC confirmed the appointment details. I’ve attached a screenshot of that email for your reference. It’s possible it was missed, but I’m glad to hear that you’ll be able to provide access tomorrow.
    Regarding alternative accommodation, it was my understanding that the agreed $800 compensation was intended to help offset those costs. If I’ve misunderstood or missed anything, please do let me know—there’s been a lot of emails, and I want to ensure nothing important is overlooked. The amount will be set as rent credit once the repair is commenced. 
    Again, I truly empathise with your situation. From what I’ve seen, Sylvia has been doing her utmost to keep communication flowing between all parties involved—yourself, the rental provider, the OC, and their plumber. Unfortunately, her ability to act is limited when the responsible party is not as responsive as we would hope.
    Please rest assured that we will continue to follow up closely and advocate for this to be resolved as quickly as possible.

        Dear Johnson,
        Thank you for your message. And honestly, I’m relieved to hear from someone new, because I don’t feel that Sylvia Hao ever fully understood what I’ve been trying to say from the start.
        Happy holiday to Sylvia — I hope she’s having a relaxing break. I wish I could take one too under the current circumstances.
        I kindly ask you to take a moment to review my past emails. At no point did I confirm that I agreed to the works or gave consent to proceed. In fact, I’ve repeatedly asked Sylvia for proper information and clarification, which I never received. The only thing I said was that I might be out of touch — which I clearly explained was because I needed a break from all this due to how much stress it had caused me. And now, after several days of silence, I suddenly receive a reminder that the works are happening tomorrow?
        I have no idea what’s going to happen to me tomorrow.
        You’re asking me to provide access for something I was never truly consulted on. I was not given 14 days’ notice. And more importantly — where do you actually expect me to stay? I just paid $2,825 in rent. I have no money for a second place. I can’t share a bedroom with my co-tenant. And no one from your office, including Sylvia, has ever addressed that properly.
        If this is the agency’s internal policy — to carry out major internal works while offering no accommodation or practical alternatives to the tenant — then please confirm that to me clearly. It would actually be helpful for me to have that confirmed, because I have now submitted this matter to VCAT and am preparing to provide a complete record of what’s happened.
        Again, I am not refusing access. I am simply asking a question that no one has answered: where am I supposed to stay?
        Also, please do not attempt to contact me by phone. I will not answer any calls. All communication must be in writing by email, as phone calls cannot be recorded or documented for evidence purposes.

                        Dear Chawakorn,
                        I hope you're well, and thank you again for your continued engagement regarding the repair matter.
                        Following instructions from the rental provider, we are now arranging to proceed with the required repairs to the water-damaged wall and flooring. These works are necessary to prevent further deterioration of the property.
                        To ensure works can commence without further delay, please expect a formal Notice of Entry to be issued on Monday, 16 June 2025. This is in accordance with the Residential Tenancies Act and will confirm the entry date and time for the Owners Corporation’s contractors to attend.
                        As previously advised, the repair process is estimated to take approximately 7–12 days. If you have any preferred times or specific availability for the week ahead, please feel free to share this by 12:00 PM Monday, 16 June, and we’ll do our best to coordinate accordingly. However, please note that access must be provided to prevent further damage and comply with maintenance obligations.
                        In terms of rent compensation, a rent credit of $800 will be applied and reflected on your ledger. This offer has been confirmed by the rental provider as final, with no further compensation to be considered.
                        If you feel the current tenancy no longer suits your circumstances, the owner is open to discussing a mutual lease termination, without penalty, should you wish to explore that option.
                        Please don’t hesitate to reach out with any further questions or concerns — we remain committed to a timely and fair resolution.
                        Warm regards,

                                    Dear Sylvia,
                                    I’ve taken some time to reflect on the communication surrounding this matter — not just in the past few days, but throughout the entire process.
                                    The meeting times proposed in your recent email were sent without any acknowledgement of my previous proposal, no explanation for the lack of response to the 9:00 AM deadline I had clearly stated, and no apology for the time and preparation that were disregarded when your office failed to respond. That silence, in itself, said a great deal.
                                    In addition, the questions I have raised — including the breakdown of the $800 figure, the repair timeline, and the specific conditions affecting my tenancy — have still not been addressed in writing. These are matters that should be readily available to your team, and I find it concerning that they remain unanswered despite repeated and reasonable requests.
                                    I’ve done my best to remain cooperative, flexible, and patient, even though I am the one living with the ongoing impact. But based on the way this has been handled, I no longer believe that an in-person meeting will lead to any meaningful resolution — especially when my time and concerns have not been respected.
                                    Accordingly, I will not be attending any further meetings. From this point forward, I will only continue this matter through formal written communication. If that clarity is not provided, I will proceed with the appropriate next steps without further notice.
                                    I have made every effort to avoid escalation. If communication continues in this pattern, the matter will simply follow its natural course.
                                    Sincerely,
                                    Chawakorn Kamnuansil

Hi Chawakorn, 
Thank you for your reply. I want to start by sincerely apologising for the inconvenience and frustration this ongoing issue has caused you. I truly understand how disruptive this must be, and I appreciate your continued patience throughout.
After reviewing the communication trail, I want to clarify that the source of the leak originates from a common area of the building, which falls under the Owners Corporation's (OC) responsibility. As a result, all scheduling and repair works need to be coordinated through them. Unfortunately, this has contributed to the delays, and I understand how frustrating that can be.
To address your first question: Sylvia did send an email on 18 June 2025 to both you and Podjana once the OC confirmed the appointment details. I’ve attached a screenshot of that email for your reference. It’s possible it was missed, but I’m glad to hear that you’ll be able to provide access tomorrow.
Regarding alternative accommodation, it was my understanding that the agreed $800 compensation was intended to help offset those costs. If I’ve misunderstood or missed anything, please do let me know—there’s been a lot of emails, and I want to ensure nothing important is overlooked. The amount will be set as rent credit once the repair is commenced. 
Again, I truly empathise with your situation. From what I’ve seen, Sylvia has been doing her utmost to keep communication flowing between all parties involved—yourself, the rental provider, the OC, and their plumber. Unfortunately, her ability to act is limited when the responsible party is not as responsive as we would hope.
Please rest assured that we will continue to follow up closely and advocate for this to be resolved as quickly as possible.

    Dear Johnson,
    Thank you for your message. And honestly, I’m relieved to hear from someone new, because I don’t feel that Sylvia Hao ever fully understood what I’ve been trying to say from the start.
    Happy holiday to Sylvia — I hope she’s having a relaxing break. I wish I could take one too under the current circumstances.
    I kindly ask you to take a moment to review my past emails. At no point did I confirm that I agreed to the works or gave consent to proceed. In fact, I’ve repeatedly asked Sylvia for proper information and clarification, which I never received. The only thing I said was that I might be out of touch — which I clearly explained was because I needed a break from all this due to how much stress it had caused me. And now, after several days of silence, I suddenly receive a reminder that the works are happening tomorrow?
    I have no idea what’s going to happen to me tomorrow.
    You’re asking me to provide access for something I was never truly consulted on. I was not given 14 days’ notice. And more importantly — where do you actually expect me to stay? I just paid $2,825 in rent. I have no money for a second place. I can’t share a bedroom with my co-tenant. And no one from your office, including Sylvia, has ever addressed that properly.
    If this is the agency’s internal policy — to carry out major internal works while offering no accommodation or practical alternatives to the tenant — then please confirm that to me clearly. It would actually be helpful for me to have that confirmed, because I have now submitted this matter to VCAT and am preparing to provide a complete record of what’s happened.
    Again, I am not refusing access. I am simply asking a question that no one has answered: where am I supposed to stay?
    Also, please do not attempt to contact me by phone. I will not answer any calls. All communication must be in writing by email, as phone calls cannot be recorded or documented for evidence purposes.
    Regards,
    Chawakorn Kamnuansil

                    Dear Chawakorn,
                    I hope you're well, and thank you again for your continued engagement regarding the repair matter.
                    Following instructions from the rental provider, we are now arranging to proceed with the required repairs to the water-damaged wall and flooring. These works are necessary to prevent further deterioration of the property.
                    To ensure works can commence without further delay, please expect a formal Notice of Entry to be issued on Monday, 16 June 2025. This is in accordance with the Residential Tenancies Act and will confirm the entry date and time for the Owners Corporation’s contractors to attend.
                    As previously advised, the repair process is estimated to take approximately 7–12 days. If you have any preferred times or specific availability for the week ahead, please feel free to share this by 12:00 PM Monday, 16 June, and we’ll do our best to coordinate accordingly. However, please note that access must be provided to prevent further damage and comply with maintenance obligations.
                    In terms of rent compensation, a rent credit of $800 will be applied and reflected on your ledger. This offer has been confirmed by the rental provider as final, with no further compensation to be considered.
                    If you feel the current tenancy no longer suits your circumstances, the owner is open to discussing a mutual lease termination, without penalty, should you wish to explore that option.
                    Please don’t hesitate to reach out with any further questions or concerns — we remain committed to a timely and fair resolution.
                    Warm regards,

                                Dear Sylvia,
                                I’ve taken some time to reflect on the communication surrounding this matter — not just in the past few days, but throughout the entire process.
                                The meeting times proposed in your recent email were sent without any acknowledgement of my previous proposal, no explanation for the lack of response to the 9:00 AM deadline I had clearly stated, and no apology for the time and preparation that were disregarded when your office failed to respond. That silence, in itself, said a great deal.
                                In addition, the questions I have raised — including the breakdown of the $800 figure, the repair timeline, and the specific conditions affecting my tenancy — have still not been addressed in writing. These are matters that should be readily available to your team, and I find it concerning that they remain unanswered despite repeated and reasonable requests.
                                I’ve done my best to remain cooperative, flexible, and patient, even though I am the one living with the ongoing impact. But based on the way this has been handled, I no longer believe that an in-person meeting will lead to any meaningful resolution — especially when my time and concerns have not been respected.
                                Accordingly, I will not be attending any further meetings. From this point forward, I will only continue this matter through formal written communication. If that clarity is not provided, I will proceed with the appropriate next steps without further notice.
                                I have made every effort to avoid escalation. If communication continues in this pattern, the matter will simply follow its natural course.
                                Sincerely,
                                Chawakorn Kamnuansil

Dear Johnson,
Thank you for your message. And honestly, I’m relieved to hear from someone new, because I don’t feel that Sylvia Hao ever fully understood what I’ve been trying to say from the start.

                            I’ve taken some time to reflect on the communication surrounding this matter — not just in the past few days, but throughout the entire process.
                            The meeting times proposed in your recent email were sent without any acknowledgement of my previous proposal, no explanation for the lack of response to the 9:00 AM deadline I had clearly stated, and no apology for the time and preparation that were disregarded when your office failed to respond. That silence, in itself, said a great deal.
                            In addition, the questions I have raised — including the breakdown of the $800 figure, the repair timeline, and the specific conditions affecting my tenancy — have still not been addressed in writing. These are matters that should be readily available to your team, and I find it concerning that they remain unanswered despite repeated and reasonable requests.
                            I’ve done my best to remain cooperative, flexible, and patient, even though I am the one living with the ongoing impact. But based on the way this has been handled, I no longer believe that an in-person meeting will lead to any meaningful resolution — especially when my time and concerns have not been respected.
                            Accordingly, I will not be attending any further meetings. From this point forward, I will only continue this matter through formal written communication. If that clarity is not provided, I will proceed with the appropriate next steps without further notice.
                            I have made every effort to avoid escalation. If communication continues in this pattern, the matter will simply follow its natural course.
                            Sincerely,

    Hi Chawakorn,
    Thanks so much for checking in and for confirming.
    We’re currently following up with the Owners Corporation to lock in the repair schedule, and we’ll send through an update as soon as we hear back from their team.
    If anything comes through today, I’ll definitely pass it on.
    Thanks again for your patience and understanding — we’re getting closer.

        just wondering if there’s any update on the general repair days or schedule?
        if you have anything rough before 9:30 monday, feel free to send it through, just so I can sort out what to do
        not a big deal either way, just thought I’d check
        i’ll probably just reply before 12:00 like you mentioned
        might be out of touch after that
        thanks

            Dear Chawakorn,
            I hope you're well, and thank you again for your continued engagement regarding the repair matter.
            Following instructions from the rental provider, we are now arranging to proceed with the required repairs to the water-damaged wall and flooring. These works are necessary to prevent further deterioration of the property.
            To ensure works can commence without further delay, please expect a formal Notice of Entry to be issued on Monday, 16 June 2025. This is in accordance with the Residential Tenancies Act and will confirm the entry date and time for the Owners Corporation’s contractors to attend.
            As previously advised, the repair process is estimated to take approximately 7–12 days. If you have any preferred times or specific availability for the week ahead, please feel free to share this by 12:00 PM Monday, 16 June, and we’ll do our best to coordinate accordingly. However, please note that access must be provided to prevent further damage and comply with maintenance obligations.
            In terms of rent compensation, a rent credit of $800 will be applied and reflected on your ledger. This offer has been confirmed by the rental provider as final, with no further compensation to be considered.
            If you feel the current tenancy no longer suits your circumstances, the owner is open to discussing a mutual lease termination, without penalty, should you wish to explore that option.
            Please don’t hesitate to reach out with any further questions or concerns — we remain committed to a timely and fair resolution.
            Warm regards,
            Sylvia Hao

Hi Chawakorn,
Thanks so much for checking in and for confirming.
We’re currently following up with the Owners Corporation to lock in the repair schedule, and we’ll send through an update as soon as we hear back from their team.
If anything comes through today, I’ll definitely pass it on.
Thanks again for your patience and understanding — we’re getting closer.
Warm regards,
Sylvia Hao

    if you have anything rough before 9:30 monday, feel free to send it through, just so I can sort out what to do
    not a big deal either way, just thought I’d check
    i’ll probably just reply before 12:00 like you mentioned
    might be out of touch after that

        Dear Chawakorn,
        I hope you're well, and thank you again for your continued engagement regarding the repair matter.
        Following instructions from the rental provider, we are now arranging to proceed with the required repairs to the water-damaged wall and flooring. These works are necessary to prevent further deterioration of the property.
        To ensure works can commence without further delay, please expect a formal Notice of Entry to be issued on Monday, 16 June 2025. This is in accordance with the Residential Tenancies Act and will confirm the entry date and time for the Owners Corporation’s contractors to attend.
        As previously advised, the repair process is estimated to take approximately 7–12 days. If you have any preferred times or specific availability for the week ahead, please feel free to share this by 12:00 PM Monday, 16 June, and we’ll do our best to coordinate accordingly. However, please note that access must be provided to prevent further damage and comply with maintenance obligations.
        In terms of rent compensation, a rent credit of $800 will be applied and reflected on your ledger. This offer has been confirmed by the rental provider as final, with no further compensation to be considered.
        If you feel the current tenancy no longer suits your circumstances, the owner is open to discussing a mutual lease termination, without penalty, should you wish to explore that option.
        Please don’t hesitate to reach out with any further questions or concerns — we remain committed to a timely and fair resolution.
        Warm regards,

                    Dear Sylvia,
                    I’ve taken some time to reflect on the communication surrounding this matter — not just in the past few days, but throughout the entire process.
                    The meeting times proposed in your recent email were sent without any acknowledgement of my previous proposal, no explanation for the lack of response to the 9:00 AM deadline I had clearly stated, and no apology for the time and preparation that were disregarded when your office failed to respond. That silence, in itself, said a great deal.
                    In addition, the questions I have raised — including the breakdown of the $800 figure, the repair timeline, and the specific conditions affecting my tenancy — have still not been addressed in writing. These are matters that should be readily available to your team, and I find it concerning that they remain unanswered despite repeated and reasonable requests.
                    I’ve done my best to remain cooperative, flexible, and patient, even though I am the one living with the ongoing impact. But based on the way this has been handled, I no longer believe that an in-person meeting will lead to any meaningful resolution — especially when my time and concerns have not been respected.
                    Accordingly, I will not be attending any further meetings. From this point forward, I will only continue this matter through formal written communication. If that clarity is not provided, I will proceed with the appropriate next steps without further notice.
                    I have made every effort to avoid escalation. If communication continues in this pattern, the matter will simply follow its natural course.

Dear Chawakorn,
I hope you're well, and thank you again for your continued engagement regarding the repair matter.
Following instructions from the rental provider, we are now arranging to proceed with the required repairs to the water-damaged wall and flooring. These works are necessary to prevent further deterioration of the property.
To ensure works can commence without further delay, please expect a formal Notice of Entry to be issued on Monday, 16 June 2025. This is in accordance with the Residential Tenancies Act and will confirm the entry date and time for the Owners Corporation’s contractors to attend.
As previously advised, the repair process is estimated to take approximately 7–12 days. If you have any preferred times or specific availability for the week ahead, please feel free to share this by 12:00 PM Monday, 16 June, and we’ll do our best to coordinate accordingly. However, please note that access must be provided to prevent further damage and comply with maintenance obligations.
In terms of rent compensation, a rent credit of $800 will be applied and reflected on your ledger. This offer has been confirmed by the rental provider as final, with no further compensation to be considered.
If you feel the current tenancy no longer suits your circumstances, the owner is open to discussing a mutual lease termination, without penalty, should you wish to explore that option.
Please don’t hesitate to reach out with any further questions or concerns — we remain committed to a timely and fair resolution.
Warm regards,
Sylvia Hao
Relationship Manager

            Dear Sylvia,
            I’ve taken some time to reflect on the communication surrounding this matter — not just in the past few days, but throughout the entire process.
            The meeting times proposed in your recent email were sent without any acknowledgement of my previous proposal, no explanation for the lack of response to the 9:00 AM deadline I had clearly stated, and no apology for the time and preparation that were disregarded when your office failed to respond. That silence, in itself, said a great deal.
            In addition, the questions I have raised — including the breakdown of the $800 figure, the repair timeline, and the specific conditions affecting my tenancy — have still not been addressed in writing. These are matters that should be readily available to your team, and I find it concerning that they remain unanswered despite repeated and reasonable requests.
            I’ve done my best to remain cooperative, flexible, and patient, even though I am the one living with the ongoing impact. But based on the way this has been handled, I no longer believe that an in-person meeting will lead to any meaningful resolution — especially when my time and concerns have not been respected.
            Accordingly, I will not be attending any further meetings. From this point forward, I will only continue this matter through formal written communication. If that clarity is not provided, I will proceed with the appropriate next steps without further notice.
            I have made every effort to avoid escalation. If communication continues in this pattern, the matter will simply follow its natural course.
            Sincerely,
            Chawakorn Kamnuansil

Such unclear and last-minute communication cannot form the basis for valid consent.

I am not trying to be confrontational; I simply need a clear and reasonable outcome, supported by appropriate action and communication.

    Dear Sylvia,
    I’ve taken some time to reflect on the communication surrounding this matter — not just in the past few days, but throughout the entire process.
    The meeting times proposed in your recent email were sent without any acknowledgement of my previous proposal, no explanation for the lack of response to the 9:00 AM deadline I had clearly stated, and no apology for the time and preparation that were disregarded when your office failed to respond. That silence, in itself, said a great deal.
    In addition, the questions I have raised — including the breakdown of the $800 figure, the repair timeline, and the specific conditions affecting my tenancy — have still not been addressed in writing. These are matters that should be readily available to your team, and I find it concerning that they remain unanswered despite repeated and reasonable requests.
    I’ve done my best to remain cooperative, flexible, and patient, even though I am the one living with the ongoing impact. But based on the way this has been handled, I no longer believe that an in-person meeting will lead to any meaningful resolution — especially when my time and concerns have not been respected.
    Accordingly, I will not be attending any further meetings. From this point forward, I will only continue this matter through formal written communication. If that clarity is not provided, I will proceed with the appropriate next steps without further notice.
    I have made every effort to avoid escalation. If communication continues in this pattern, the matter will simply follow its natural course.
    Sincerely,
    Chawakorn Kamnuansil

Such unclear and last-minute communication cannot form the basis for valid consent.

        Dear Sylvia,
        Thank you again for your recent update, and for forwarding the proposed rent adjustment of $800.
        As I’ve mentioned previously, I’m still very open to resolving this matter directly and as fairly as possible, given the nature and duration of the disruption.
        Before I can respond to the proposed amount, I’d really appreciate your clarification on a few key points, just so there’s no confusion going forward:
            How exactly was the $800 figure calculated?
            What time period does it cover?
            Does it reflect one tenant or both of us?
            If accepted, would that payment mean I can’t raise other issues like earlier disruption or temporary accommodation?
            And what’s the current expected repair timeline?
        From my side, I’ve been looking at the impact from around 15 April, which is when the issue started and when I first reached out. So I hope that context can be considered as part of your team’s preparation before we meet. It would really help if everything could be brought or explained clearly during the discussion, so we don’t go in circles.
        To keep things moving forward, I’d like to propose an in-person meeting at your office on Thursday, 12 June at 10:30 AM. I’ll be bringing a support person with me as well. Nothing formal — just someone to help me navigate things clearly.
        If this time doesn’t work for your team, please let me know by 9:00 AM Thursday. If I don’t hear back by then, I’ll assume the meeting can’t go ahead as suggested and will take the next steps from there.
        Thank you again — I’m still hopeful we can bring this to a clear and fair resolution.

                Thank you for your email and for clearly outlining your concerns. We completely understand the frustration and inconvenience this ongoing issue has caused, and we truly appreciate your patience.
                Repair Timeline:
                We have formally submitted your 30% rent reduction request to the Owners Corporation and are awaiting their response. Once we receive their feedback, we will provide you with a confirmed repair timeline and projected completion date.
                Temporary Relocation:
                As discussed, the affected bedroom will need to be vacant during the repair work, including the installation of drying equipment.
                Co-Tenant Impact:
                We recognize that your co-tenant will also be affected by these repairs. Please rest assured that we will keep both of you informed about the repair schedule and any potential disruptions.
                We fully respect your decision to withhold consent until these matters are fully addressed in writing. We are working to resolve this as quickly as possible and will provide all the necessary details as soon as they are available.
                If you have any further questions or need additional clarification, please don’t hesitate to reach out.
                Kind regards,

                    Dear Sylvia,
                    Thank you for your response dated Friday, 6 June 2025 at 11:50am.
                    As the primary resident of the property who has lived through weeks of unresolved water damage, I must reiterate that no one is more eager than I am to see the situation resolved quickly and properly. However, I am currently unable to provide consent for any repair work to begin.
                    Firstly, your email referred to repairs commencing on ""Thursday, 6 June""a date which had already passed at the time of your message. This inconsistency is not just confusing; it is logistically impossible and calls into question the seriousness of the repair planning. Such unclear and last-minute communication cannot form the basis for valid consent.
                    Secondly, I must emphasise that I cannot authorise access until the following points are clearly confirmed in writing:
                    1. A definitive and specific repair timeline, including projected completion date.
                    2. Whether temporary relocation will be required, and if so, what arrangements or compensation are being offered.
                    3. Your position on my formal request for rent reduction and confirmation of non-liability, which remain outstanding.
                    4. Acknowledgment of the impact on my co-tenant, who is also named in the lease agreement, and who will equally be affected by noise and accessibility issues related to the drying equipment.
                    It is my responsibility to ensure that any agreement made does not inadvertently waive our legal rights or create further hardship. I must act cautiously, especially as the installation of industrial drying equipment operating 24/7 poses real disturbancessomething your office acknowledged in our previous phone call.
                    If I were to consent now without these matters resolved in writing, it could later be used to suggest that I accepted all resulting conditions, which I absolutely do not.
                    Therefore, I will only provide access once I receive formal written confirmation addressing all points above. Until then, I consider it unreasonable to demand a commitment from me, especially under these unclear and one-sided circumstances.
                    As noted in my formal demand, if a resolution is not reached within five (5) calendar daysincluding weekendsI will proceed to file an application with VCAT.
                    Kind regards,
                    Chawakorn Kamnuansil

                        We understand the impact this situation has had on your tenancy and appreciate the way you’ve approached the matter. We will now forward your request and documentation to the Owners Corporation for consideration of a rent compensation claim based on the current circumstances.
                        In the meantime, we are aiming to proceed with the repair works as soon as possible. Could you kindly confirm whether works can commence on Thursday, 6 June 2025, or let us know your earliest availability to provide access?
                        We will continue to keep you updated as we receive further information from the Owners Corporation.

                            I am writing with the intent of resolving this matter constructively and without escalation, if possible.
                            Over the past two months, I have reported the water damage issue multiple times in good faith, cooperated with your office, and done my best to remain in the property despite the difficulties. I am not trying to be confrontational; I simply need a clear and reasonable outcome, supported by appropriate action and communication.

            Dear Sylvia,
            Thank you for your response dated Friday, 6 June 2025 at 11:50am.
            As the primary resident of the property who has lived through weeks of unresolved water damage, I must reiterate that no one is more eager than I am to see the situation resolved quickly and properly. However, I am currently unable to provide consent for any repair work to begin.
            Firstly, your email referred to repairs commencing on ""Thursday, 6 June""a date which had already passed at the time of your message. This inconsistency is not just confusing; it is logistically impossible and calls into question the seriousness of the repair planning. Such unclear and last-minute communication cannot form the basis for valid consent.
            Secondly, I must emphasise that I cannot authorise access until the following points are clearly confirmed in writing:
            1. A definitive and specific repair timeline, including projected completion date.
            2. Whether temporary relocation will be required, and if so, what arrangements or compensation are being offered.
            3. Your position on my formal request for rent reduction and confirmation of non-liability, which remain outstanding.
            4. Acknowledgment of the impact on my co-tenant, who is also named in the lease agreement, and who will equally be affected by noise and accessibility issues related to the drying equipment.
            It is my responsibility to ensure that any agreement made does not inadvertently waive our legal rights or create further hardship. I must act cautiously, especially as the installation of industrial drying equipment operating 24/7 poses real disturbancessomething your office acknowledged in our previous phone call.
            If I were to consent now without these matters resolved in writing, it could later be used to suggest that I accepted all resulting conditions, which I absolutely do not.
            Therefore, I will only provide access once I receive formal written confirmation addressing all points above. Until then, I consider it unreasonable to demand a commitment from me, especially under these unclear and one-sided circumstances.
            As noted in my formal demand, if a resolution is not reached within five (5) calendar daysincluding weekendsI will proceed to file an application with VCAT.
            Kind regards,
            Chawakorn Kamnuansil

Dear Chawakorn,
I’ve received confirmation from the Owners Corporation that they are happy to proceed with the previously proposed rent reduction of $800.00.
Could you kindly confirm if you’re happy with this adjustment?
Once confirmed, we’ll proceed accordingly.

Dear Sylvia,
Thank you for your response dated Friday, 6 June 2025 at 11:50am.
As the primary resident of the property who has lived through weeks of unresolved water damage, I must reiterate that no one is more eager than I am to see the situation resolved quickly and properly. However, I am currently unable to provide consent for any repair work to begin.
Firstly, your email referred to repairs commencing on ""Thursday, 6 June""a date which had already passed at the time of your message. This inconsistency is not just confusing; it is logistically impossible and calls into question the seriousness of the repair planning. Such unclear and last-minute communication cannot form the basis for valid consent.
Secondly, I must emphasise that I cannot authorise access until the following points are clearly confirmed in writing:
1. A definitive and specific repair timeline, including projected completion date.
2. Whether temporary relocation will be required, and if so, what arrangements or compensation are being offered.
3. Your position on my formal request for rent reduction and confirmation of non-liability, which remain outstanding.
4. Acknowledgment of the impact on my co-tenant, who is also named in the lease agreement, and who will equally be affected by noise and accessibility issues related to the drying equipment.
It is my responsibility to ensure that any agreement made does not inadvertently waive our legal rights or create further hardship. I must act cautiously, especially as the installation of industrial drying equipment operating 24/7 poses real disturbancessomething your office acknowledged in our previous phone call.
If I were to consent now without these matters resolved in writing, it could later be used to suggest that I accepted all resulting conditions, which I absolutely do not.
Therefore, I will only provide access once I receive formal written confirmation addressing all points above. Until then, I consider it unreasonable to demand a commitment from me, especially under these unclear and one-sided circumstances.
As noted in my formal demand, if a resolution is not reached within five (5) calendar daysincluding weekendsI will proceed to file an application with VCAT.
Kind regards,
Chawakorn Kamnuansil

Hi Chawakorn,
I hope you're well.
Following our recent discussions regarding the damage in the bedroom and the upcoming remediation works, I wanted to provide you with an update.
The cause of the leak and damage has been identified as originating from the common roof, which falls under the responsibility of the Owners Corporation (Highrise Strata). We’ve approached them regarding possible rent compensation for the temporary loss of use of the affected bedroom.
While this type of situation doesn’t meet the insurance excess threshold for a formal claim, the Owners Corporation has advised they may consider a rent reduction of approximately 10% to 30% during the works, depending on the impact and supporting documentation.
To proceed, they require a formal written request from you, outlining:
Your request for rent compensation;
The amount requested (e.g., 30%);
A brief explanation (e.g., inability to use the bedroom due to drying equipment or repairs).
I'm more than happy to support a request for the higher end of the range (30%) on your behalf. Please let me know if you’re comfortable with this, and feel free to send me your formal request so we can submit it to the Owners Corporation for review.
If you have any questions or need help wording your request, I’m here to assist.
Looking forward to hearing from you.
Warm regards,
Sylvia Hao
Relationship Manager

    Dear Sylvia,
    Thank you for your email.
    I confirm that access to the bedroom can be provided as required to facilitate the scheduled repairs. I will ensure that personal items are removed in time.
    However, I must formally note that the water intrusion, plaster damage, and associated issues have been ongoing since approximately 15 April 2025. I submitted multiple written reports, yet no action was taken to mitigate the impact for several weeks. This has resulted in substantial disruption and compromised my ability to safely and reasonably occupy the premises.
    Given this, I request that your office assess and propose an appropriate rent reduction or compensation, in line with the responsibilities of the rental provider under the Residential Tenancies Act 1997 (VIC). The current circumstances reflect a clear breach of my right to quiet enjoyment, as well as your obligation to attend to urgent repairs in a timely manner.
    I also wish to express concern regarding the proposed solution that I relocate for the duration of repairs without any logistical or financial support. It is not reasonable to expect me to independently secure alternative accommodation within a constrained budget. The responsibility for this situation does not rest with me, and I cannot be expected to bear its consequences. Furthermore, while I appreciate the owner’s offer to stay at their Mount Waverley residence, I must respectfully decline. My daily activities, work, and personal needs are based in the city, and any temporary solution must reflect the realities of my lifestyle and commitments.
    I will cooperate within reason, but I ask that the proposed solution be revisited in good faith to ensure it does not transfer the burden to me for a matter caused by delays in your agency’s response.
    Please also note that I will not accept any further contact by telephone. All future communication must be conducted via email only to avoid disruption to my work and to maintain a written record.
    If no compensation or reasonable resolution is offered within five business days, I will consider escalating the matter by submitting a formal application to the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal (VCAT). I remain open to resolving this amicably, but the solution must be fair, timely, and consistent with the facts of the situation.
    Kind regards,
    Chawakorn Kamnuansil

        Hi Podjana,
        Thank you for your time on the phone earlier.
        As discussed, there is potential mould growth and further damage to the carpet and plaster in the affected bedroom. The building strata and property owners are actively pursuing remediation works to prevent further deterioration.
        To move forward, we kindly ask for your confirmation regarding access to the bedroom so that the necessary works can proceed.
        Please confirm at your earliest convenience.

            Hi Charwakorn,
            Just a quick update—OC contractor has confirmed that one of the affected rooms will need to remain inaccessible during the drying process. Drying equipment will be placed in that bedroom, and please note it does emit a moderate level of noise and unfortunately cannot be switched off during operation.
            If you prefer not to move out during this period, you're welcome to share the second bedroom or use the living area as a temporary alternative. Could you please confirm if access can be arranged for the drying equipment to be installed?
            Let us know what works best for you, and we’ll do our best to assist.

                    Hi Sylvia,
                     
                    Thanks for your reply. Here’s an update on the wall — although the water has dried, there is still a visible stain and surface warping, as shown in the attached photo.
                     
                    I’ve done my best to manage it temporarily using Gumption, but this is clearly not a long-term solution and shouldn’t fall under the tenant’s responsibility.
                     
                    The wall is still visibly damaged and the room remains unsuitable for normal use. I need to know when someone will be sent to inspect and repair the affected area. This needs to be addressed properly, not just acknowledged.
                     
                    Also, for record-keeping purposes, all communication regarding this matter must be done via email, as phone calls cannot be documented as evidence if needed.
                     
                    I expect a response with a clear action plan and timeline.
                     
                    Best regards,
                    Chawakorn

                        The plumber who attended the unit last Wednesday was arranged by the Owner’s Corporation to address the leak from the hot water system. We are currently waiting on their formal report to confirm that the issue has been fully resolved.
                         
                        In the meantime, could you please let me know if there has been any further water ingress or signs of dampness since their visit? This will help ensure there are no ongoing issues.
                         
                        Once we receive confirmation that the source of the leak is no longer active, we will arrange for quotations to repair the internal damage, including the wall and potentially affected carpet and underlay.
                         
                        I understand how frustrating this situation is and will continue to follow up with the relevant parties to ensure the matter is addressed appropriately.

Dear Sylvia,
Thank you for your email.
I confirm that access to the bedroom can be provided as required to facilitate the scheduled repairs. I will ensure that personal items are removed in time.
However, I must formally note that the water intrusion, plaster damage, and associated issues have been ongoing since approximately 15 April 2025. I submitted multiple written reports, yet no action was taken to mitigate the impact for several weeks. This has resulted in substantial disruption and compromised my ability to safely and reasonably occupy the premises.
Given this, I request that your office assess and propose an appropriate rent reduction or compensation, in line with the responsibilities of the rental provider under the Residential Tenancies Act 1997 (VIC). The current circumstances reflect a clear breach of my right to quiet enjoyment, as well as your obligation to attend to urgent repairs in a timely manner.
I also wish to express concern regarding the proposed solution that I relocate for the duration of repairs without any logistical or financial support. It is not reasonable to expect me to independently secure alternative accommodation within a constrained budget. The responsibility for this situation does not rest with me, and I cannot be expected to bear its consequences. Furthermore, while I appreciate the owner’s offer to stay at their Mount Waverley residence, I must respectfully decline. My daily activities, work, and personal needs are based in the city, and any temporary solution must reflect the realities of my lifestyle and commitments.
I will cooperate within reason, but I ask that the proposed solution be revisited in good faith to ensure it does not transfer the burden to me for a matter caused by delays in your agency’s response.
Please also note that I will not accept any further contact by telephone. All future communication must be conducted via email only to avoid disruption to my work and to maintain a written record.
If no compensation or reasonable resolution is offered within five business days, I will consider escalating the matter by submitting a formal application to the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal (VCAT). I remain open to resolving this amicably, but the solution must be fair, timely, and consistent with the facts of the situation.
Kind regards,
Chawakorn Kamnuansil

    Hi Podjana,
    Thank you for your time on the phone earlier.
    As discussed, there is potential mould growth and further damage to the carpet and plaster in the affected bedroom. The building strata and property owners are actively pursuing remediation works to prevent further deterioration.
    To move forward, we kindly ask for your confirmation regarding access to the bedroom so that the necessary works can proceed.
    Please confirm at your earliest convenience.

        Hi Charwakorn,
        Just a quick update—OC contractor has confirmed that one of the affected rooms will need to remain inaccessible during the drying process. Drying equipment will be placed in that bedroom, and please note it does emit a moderate level of noise and unfortunately cannot be switched off during operation.
        If you prefer not to move out during this period, you're welcome to share the second bedroom or use the living area as a temporary alternative. Could you please confirm if access can be arranged for the drying equipment to be installed?
        Let us know what works best for you, and we’ll do our best to assist.

            Hi Chawakorn,
            Thank you for your detailed update and the photo.
            I’ve followed up with the Owners Corporation to confirm that the leak has been resolved, and I’ve requested that the necessary rectification works be arranged without further delay. I’ve also asked them to provide a clear timeline for inspection and repairs.
            I understand the inconvenience this has caused and appreciate your continued patience. I’ll keep you updated as soon as I receive a confirmed plan from their side.

                Hi Sylvia,
                 
                Thanks for your reply. Here’s an update on the wall — although the water has dried, there is still a visible stain and surface warping, as shown in the attached photo.
                 
                I’ve done my best to manage it temporarily using Gumption, but this is clearly not a long-term solution and shouldn’t fall under the tenant’s responsibility.
                 
                The wall is still visibly damaged and the room remains unsuitable for normal use. I need to know when someone will be sent to inspect and repair the affected area. This needs to be addressed properly, not just acknowledged.
                 
                Also, for record-keeping purposes, all communication regarding this matter must be done via email, as phone calls cannot be documented as evidence if needed.
                 
                I expect a response with a clear action plan and timeline.

                    The plumber who attended the unit last Wednesday was arranged by the Owner’s Corporation to address the leak from the hot water system. We are currently waiting on their formal report to confirm that the issue has been fully resolved.
                     
                    In the meantime, could you please let me know if there has been any further water ingress or signs of dampness since their visit? This will help ensure there are no ongoing issues.
                     
                    Once we receive confirmation that the source of the leak is no longer active, we will arrange for quotations to repair the internal damage, including the wall and potentially affected carpet and underlay.
                     
                    I understand how frustrating this situation is and will continue to follow up with the relevant parties to ensure the matter is addressed appropriately.

                Hi Sylvia,
                 
                It’s been over a week since the plumber attended, and I’ve yet to see any update or progress on the condition of my unit. I had already sent photos clearly showing wall damage — fixing the leak alone doesn’t resolve everything.
                 
                This unit is carpeted, and the leak went on for days. It’s only logical to assume the carpet and underlay have been affected too. Does it really make sense to think the issue ends with the hot water pipe?
                 
                Also, why has there been complete silence? It’s not even during a public holiday period this time, and yet I’m still left waiting with no information. Is the delay coming from the building manager, or is the owner just not interested in maintaining their own property?
                 
                I’ve been patient long enough. Please advise what steps are being taken regarding both the wall and the carpet, and whether an inspection will be arranged.
                 
                Regards,
                Chawakorn

Hi Charwakorn,
Just a quick update—OC contractor has confirmed that one of the affected rooms will need to remain inaccessible during the drying process. Drying equipment will be placed in that bedroom, and please note it does emit a moderate level of noise and unfortunately cannot be switched off during operation.
If you prefer not to move out during this period, you're welcome to share the second bedroom or use the living area as a temporary alternative. Could you please confirm if access can be arranged for the drying equipment to be installed?

        I’ve done my best to manage it temporarily using Gumption, but this is clearly not a long-term solution and shouldn’t fall under the tenant’s responsibility.
         
        The wall is still visibly damaged and the room remains unsuitable for normal use. I need to know when someone will be sent to inspect and repair the affected area. This needs to be addressed properly, not just acknowledged.
         
        Also, for record-keeping purposes, all communication regarding this matter must be done via email, as phone calls cannot be documented as evidence if needed.
         
        I expect a response with a clear action plan and timeline.
         
        Best regards,
        Chawakorn

            Hi Chawakorn,
             
            Thank you for your email, and I do apologise for the lack of updates — I understand your concerns and appreciate your continued patience.
             
            The plumber who attended the unit last Wednesday was arranged by the Owner’s Corporation to address the leak from the hot water system. We are currently waiting on their formal report to confirm that the issue has been fully resolved.
             
            In the meantime, could you please let me know if there has been any further water ingress or signs of dampness since their visit? This will help ensure there are no ongoing issues.
             
            Once we receive confirmation that the source of the leak is no longer active, we will arrange for quotations to repair the internal damage, including the wall and potentially affected carpet and underlay.
             
            I understand how frustrating this situation is and will continue to follow up with the relevant parties to ensure the matter is addressed appropriately.

            Subject: Follow-up on Wall and Carpet Damage – 1803/243 Franklin St
             
            Hi Sylvia,
             
            It’s been over a week since the plumber attended, and I’ve yet to see any update or progress on the condition of my unit. I had already sent photos clearly showing wall damage — fixing the leak alone doesn’t resolve everything.
             
            This unit is carpeted, and the leak went on for days. It’s only logical to assume the carpet and underlay have been affected too. Does it really make sense to think the issue ends with the hot water pipe?
             
            Also, why has there been complete silence? It’s not even during a public holiday period this time, and yet I’m still left waiting with no information. Is the delay coming from the building manager, or is the owner just not interested in maintaining their own property?
             
            I’ve been patient long enough. Please advise what steps are being taken regarding both the wall and the carpet, and whether an inspection will be arranged.
             
            Regards,
            Chawakorn

Hi Chawarkorn,
I hope you're well.
The Owners Corporation has engaged Fixd Trade to carry out internal rectification works and a moisture survey in relation to the leak from the common roof.
Fixd Trade will need access to your apartment to proceed. Could you please let me know your availability so I can coordinate with them and arrange a suitable time?
Their lead time to start is quite short, so your prompt response would be greatly appreciated.
Kind regards,
Sylvia Hao

Hi Chawakorn,
Thank you for your detailed update and the photo.
I’ve followed up with the Owners Corporation to confirm that the leak has been resolved, and I’ve requested that the necessary rectification works be arranged without further delay. I’ve also asked them to provide a clear timeline for inspection and repairs.
I understand the inconvenience this has caused and appreciate your continued patience. I’ll keep you updated as soon as I receive a confirmed plan from their side.
Best regards,
Sylvia Hao

    Hi Sylvia,
     
    Thanks for your reply. Here’s an update on the wall — although the water has dried, there is still a visible stain and surface warping, as shown in the attached photo.
     
    I’ve done my best to manage it temporarily using Gumption, but this is clearly not a long-term solution and shouldn’t fall under the tenant’s responsibility.
     
    The wall is still visibly damaged and the room remains unsuitable for normal use. I need to know when someone will be sent to inspect and repair the affected area. This needs to be addressed properly, not just acknowledged.
     
    Also, for record-keeping purposes, all communication regarding this matter must be done via email, as phone calls cannot be documented as evidence if needed.
     
    I expect a response with a clear action plan and timeline.
     
    Best regards,
    Chawakorn

        Thank you for your email, and I do apologise for the lack of updates — I understand your concerns and appreciate your continued patience.
         
        The plumber who attended the unit last Wednesday was arranged by the Owner’s Corporation to address the leak from the hot water system. We are currently waiting on their formal report to confirm that the issue has been fully resolved.
         
        In the meantime, could you please let me know if there has been any further water ingress or signs of dampness since their visit? This will help ensure there are no ongoing issues.
         
        Once we receive confirmation that the source of the leak is no longer active, we will arrange for quotations to repair the internal damage, including the wall and potentially affected carpet and underlay.
         
        I understand how frustrating this situation is and will continue to follow up with the relevant parties to ensure the matter is addressed appropriately.

        Hi Sylvia,
         
        It’s been over a week since the plumber attended, and I’ve yet to see any update or progress on the condition of my unit. I had already sent photos clearly showing wall damage — fixing the leak alone doesn’t resolve everything.
         
        This unit is carpeted, and the leak went on for days. It’s only logical to assume the carpet and underlay have been affected too. Does it really make sense to think the issue ends with the hot water pipe?
         
        Also, why has there been complete silence? It’s not even during a public holiday period this time, and yet I’m still left waiting with no information. Is the delay coming from the building manager, or is the owner just not interested in maintaining their own property?
         
        I’ve been patient long enough. Please advise what steps are being taken regarding both the wall and the carpet, and whether an inspection will be arranged.
         
        Regards,
        Chawakorn

Hi Chawakorn,
I just wanted to give you a quick update. The Strata's plumber attended to the hot water leak last Wednesday and has addressed the issue. I’ll be confirming with the building management shortly if there’s any further action needed.
Could you please let me know if you've noticed any further water ingress or any issues since the plumber's visit?
Thanks for your help.

Hi Chawakorn,
  
We're writing to inform you about the upcoming Routine Inspection of the property. This inspection is an essential step for us to understand the current condition of the property, identify any necessary maintenance, and plan for future works.
Inspection Date & Time:
The inspection will take place on 1/05/2025 between 9.00 am and 5:30 pm. We understand that it's a broad timeframe, but we assure you that we will do our best to minimize any inconvenience.
 
What We'll Look At:
  During our inspection, our primary focus will be on:
    The overall condition of the home
    Lawns (ensuring they're mowed)
    Garden beds (checking they're weed-free)
    Bathroom (for any mould presence)
    Shower tiles & grout (Clean & free of mould & soap scum)
    Exhaust fans (cleanliness of covers)
    Oven & rangehood filters (surfaces are clean & free of grease)
Access & Personal Belongings:
For ease of access, we'll be using our spare keys. If there are any personal belongings or valuable items you'd prefer to secure, especially if you won't be present, kindly do so ahead of our visit.
  
Photos for Reporting:
We will take photographs of the property during our inspection. Rest assured, our cameras are designed to automatically blur any faces, including those in photographs, to prioritize and protect your privacy. If there are any personal items you'd prefer not to be captured, please move them out of sight for the duration of the inspection.
Maintenance Requests:
If there's any maintenance or concerns you'd like us to be aware of, we request you to provide this in writing.
We appreciate your cooperation in this matter. Should you have any questions or concerns about the upcoming inspection, please don't hesitate to reach out to me.

Hi Chawakorn,
Just a quick update — the OC sent plumber inspected the roof this morning and confirmed that the main issue is a leak from the hot water system. They’ve recommended getting a plumber out as soon as possible to fix it.
Once the repair is done, another inspection may be needed to ensure no damage to the membrane around the area.
We will request OC to reinstate the walls once leaking fixed.
Thanks for your patience, and I’ll keep you posted on the progress.
Kind regards,
Sylvia Hao

Hi Chawakorn,
Thank you for your follow-up, and I’m sorry for the continued inconvenience you’ve been experiencing.
Under the owner’s instructions, we’ve managed to arrange for the Owners Corporation to inspect the roof next week, after multiple attempts. We’ll be sure to keep you updated as soon as we have further information from them.
Additionally, we will notify the Owners Corporation about the water ingress into the carpet and the ongoing damage.
We’ve also updated your contact number on our end to ensure we have the correct details moving forward.
We truly appreciate your patience, and we’re working to resolve this as quickly as possible.
Kind regards,
Sylvia Hao

    Dear Sylvia,
     
    I hope you are doing well.
     
    I’m writing again to follow up on the urgent water leakage issue in my unit (1803, 243 Franklin Street), which I first reported prior to the Easter holiday.
     
    At the time, I was advised that this would be treated as a priority and was also provided with a contact list for emergency tradespeople. In accordance with that advice, I reached out to Flood Response as listed. Unfortunately, they replied stating that they were closed on Easter Monday and unable to attend. I’ve attached a screenshot of their message for reference.
     
    Since then, I have not received any updates or confirmation regarding the next steps, even though the holiday period has now ended. Meanwhile, the situation has continued to worsen.
     
    Attached are the most recent photos taken today, clearly showing the ceiling stains spreading further, severe wall swelling, and visible water marks continuing to develop. More critically, as the flooring in my room is carpeted, water has now begun to soak into the carpet, creating both dampness and a persistent musty odour.
     
    This is no longer just a structural concern — it now directly affects my personal living conditions and health. The continued moisture increases the risk of mould developing beneath the carpet, which could pose serious health risks and result in more extensive damage if not addressed immediately.
     
    I’ve followed every step requested and have been as patient as possible. However, at this stage, I must insist on urgent action. I trust that I will not be held responsible for any resulting damages, especially given that I have reported the issue early and complied with all procedures.
     
    Please confirm when a professional will attend the property to inspect and begin repairs. I’d truly appreciate your prompt attention and resolution to this matter.
     
    Also, if possible, could you please update my contact details to ensure you’re using my current number: 0449 962 645.
    For the previous issue regarding the bed, I suspect there may have been an attempt to reach me on an outdated number.
     
    Kind regards,

What We'll Look At:
  During our inspection, our primary focus will be on:
    The overall condition of the home

We will take photographs of the property during our inspection. Rest assured, our cameras are designed to automatically blur any faces, including those in photographs, to prioritize and protect your privacy.

Dear Hilary and Sylvia,
I hope you are both doing well.
I am writing to kindly follow up regarding the water leakage issue in my unit (1803, 243 Franklin Street) which I first reported on 16 April. 
Since then, the situation has unfortunately worsened. The water damage has expanded across the ceiling and wall, and the swelling and staining have become noticeably more severe. I have attached updated photos for your reference.
I completely understand that it has been a busy period with the Easter holidays. However, given the current condition, I am concerned about the potential for further damage and health risks due to prolonged moisture.
May I kindly ask for an update regarding the next steps or any arrangements being made?
If a professional inspection could be organised soon, it would be greatly appreciated to help prevent any further complications.
Thank you very much for your time and support. I truly appreciate your help in resolving this matter.
Kind regards,
Chawakorn Kamnuansil

    Dear Hilary,
     
    I’m contacting you regarding an urgent issue in my unit (1803, 243 Franklin Street). This evening , I noticed a water leak forming on the wall above my bed. Within a single day, it spread rapidly — now forming a long vertical swelling nearly from ceiling to floor.
     
    I live on the top floor, so this may indicate a ceiling or roof issue. I’m concerned it could worsen quickly if not addressed.
     
    Please arrange for a maintenance inspection as soon as possible. I’ve attached photos for reference. Let me know if I need to do anything in the meantime.
     
    Also, I’d appreciate an update on the status of the bed repair I previously reported.

Subject: Urgent: Water Damage on Bedroom Wall (Unit 1803)
 
Dear Hilary,
 
I’m contacting you regarding an urgent issue in my unit (1803, 243 Franklin Street). This evening , I noticed a water leak forming on the wall above my bed. Within a single day, it spread rapidly — now forming a long vertical swelling nearly from ceiling to floor.
 
I live on the top floor, so this may indicate a ceiling or roof issue. I’m concerned it could worsen quickly if not addressed.
 
Please arrange for a maintenance inspection as soon as possible. I’ve attached photos for reference. Let me know if I need to do anything in the meantime.
 
Also, I’d appreciate an update on the status of the bed repair I previously reported.
 
Thanks,
Chawakorn

Subject: Fwd: Non-Urgent Maintenance Request (1803/243 Franklin st) – Broken Bed Frame with Exposed Nails
 
Dear Hilary,
 
I hope this message finds you well. Thank you for your recent correspondence and for processing my payment receipt — much appreciated.
 
I’m writing to follow up on a non-urgent maintenance request I originally submitted on 2 April regarding the deteriorating bed frame in my apartment (Unit 1803, 243 Franklin Street, Melbourne VIC 3000). As I haven’t received a response to that email yet, I wanted to make sure it was received and kindly ask for your guidance on the next steps.
 
To help move things forward without adding to your team’s workload, I’d like to propose an alternative solution — if it’s possible under your policy, I’d be happy to purchase and install a new bed frame myself, and then submit the official receipt for reimbursement under the maintenance allowance.
 
This would:
• Save time coordinating with contractors,
• Allow me to select a frame that suits my needs,
• And reduce the administrative load on your side.
 
Of course, I would only proceed if it’s approved in advance and would comply with any requirements you may have in terms of budget, documentation, or supplier type.
 
If this approach is acceptable, could you please kindly advise:
1. What the maximum reimbursable budget would be?
2. How long it typically takes for reimbursement after submitting receipts?
 
I’ve forwarded the original email below for your reference, along with photos and details.
 
Thank you very much for your time and understanding. I really appreciate your help and look forward to hearing from you soon.
 
Warm regards,

Dear Property Management Team,
 
I hope this message finds you well.
 
I’m writing to report a non-urgent maintenance issue regarding the bed frame in my apartment at Unit 1803, 243 Franklin Street, Melbourne VIC 3000. I’ve attached several photos that show the condition of the bed clearly.
 
Over time, the frame has become structurally compromised due to regular usage. I can confidently confirm that there has been no misuse on my part. Recently, the issue has worsened—one side of the frame has come apart and exposed some nails. Unfortunately, I did sustain a light scratch on my leg because of this.
 
The misalignment also makes it very difficult to use the drawer underneath the bed, and the headboard has started to detach slightly as well. Items often fall into the gap that’s opened up behind the bed, and I’m hesitant to reach in due to the protruding nails.
 
I understand that other tenants may be facing more urgent problems and I’m happy to wait my turn—this is not an emergency. I just wanted to make sure it’s on record, and that it can hopefully be addressed when it’s suitable for your schedule.
 
Please feel free to reach out if you need any more details or clarification. I appreciate your help and look forward to hearing from you when possible.
