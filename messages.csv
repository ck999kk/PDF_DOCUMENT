Near-CBD, quiet for daytime rest, with a desk and internet.\n    Work window (choose day-by-day; confirm ≥24h in advance)\n    • If accommodation is provided that day: full window 08:00–16:00 AEST. I’ll be off-site.\n    • If no accommodation that day: two short blocks 09:00–12:00 and 16:00–18:00 AEST; during 12:00–16:00 there should be no entry and no noisy/heat-generating equipment in the unit.\n    Simple daily brief (non-technical): which areas to clear, whether I should be on/off-site and for roughly how long, any do’s/don’ts, when it’s safe to re-use the space, and a single on-site email contact.\n    Utilities & cleanliness: agency covers additional power/water from the works; tidy daily; restore condition on completion.\n    Tenancy & rent: temporary relocation is not a surrender. On any day accommodation isn’t provided as agreed, or the bedroom remains unusable, daily rent abatement applies for that day.\n    Property damage: any damage/loss arising from the works is the agency/contractor’s responsibility; please confirm the remediation plan and timeframe in writing the same day it’s identified.\n    No “no-access” & comms: no “no-access” or similar charges unless ordered by the Tribunal; email-only communication for records.\nPlease send the accommodation details (location/dates/terms), specify the daily time mode, and the simple brief by 30 Aug 2025, 17:00 AEST.

I understand this has been a frustrating and challenging situation, and I appreciate you taking the time to outline your position.\n \nThe damage to the bedroom has resulted from a leak originating from common property. Responsibility for repairing both the source of the leak and the resultant damage lies with the party responsible — in this case, the Owners Corporation. They have taken steps to arrange the necessary works and have offered $800 in compensation to reflect the inconvenience caused to date.\n \nDespite multiple written requests and the issuing of a formal Notice of Entry, access to the property has not yet been provided. We understand you may have concerns, but the works are essential, and the Owners Corporation has been actively trying to resolve the issue. We are currently waiting on a revised date from their trades. Once confirmed, a new Notice of Entry will be issued. On that date, both the agent and trades will attend to carry out the works. If access is again refused, we will proceed with an application to VCAT for a compliance order.\n \nOur preference is to cooperate with you to ensure the repairs can proceed on the earliest available date. The sooner access is granted, the sooner this matter can be resolved.\n \nWe remain open to working with you constructively. During the VCAT hearing, the Tribunal member noted that staying in the second bedroom or the lounge room during the repair period would be a reasonable short-term arrangement. While we understand the second bedroom is currently occupied by the other tenant and this may not be ideal, it remains a temporary option to consider. If that arrangement isn’t workable, the option to end the lease early without penalty remains available.\n \nIn regard to your proposal, we do not agree to the requested $10,000 lump sum or a 24-month rent freeze. These terms are not proportionate, particularly given that access for repairs has not yet been provided. Any future compensation claim would also be assessed in light of whether reasonable steps were taken to mitigate loss. In this case, the matter could have been resolved some time ago had access been granted.\n \nWe’ll be in touch again once the repair date is confirmed. In the meantime, we ask that you confirm your willingness to allow access on the upcoming date, so the matter can be finalised without further escalation.\n \n \nKind Regards,\n	Jamie Ong\nHead of Property Management\n0492 801 841 \njamie.ong@areal.com.au\n03 9818 8991\n33 Camberwell Road Hawthorn East VIC 3123\nwww.areal.com.au \narealbrandmarkgreygreen.png 	web.png facebook.png instagram.png youtube.png linkedin.png\nEmail Signatures Awards 2025 - Resize.png\nDISCLAIMER & WARNING.

(This may be sooner for urgent cases.)\nClick the link to upload and submit your evidence. Ensure you have shared these files with the other party. Do not submit any other information using this link.\nIf you have multiple cases in progress, they will each have a separate upload link.\nThe link is active for 6 months from the date it is sent to you. If the case is still active after 6 months, you will require a new link. \nIf you are attending a hearing in person at one of our VCAT venues, you must also bring a paper copy of all your documents to the hearing for the Member. If you have not provided VCAT with an email address, please contact us immediately on renting@courts.vic.gov.au to advise of your email address and ask for your evidence link.\nIf you do not have a copy of the link, please email renting@courts.vic.gov.au\nHow to send and access evidence in a residential tenancy case | VCAT\nEstimated time to VCAT\nWe prioritise cases that the renting laws say must be heard within a certain time, and those we consider urgent. For example, urgent repairs are heard within 2 business days, and applications involving personal or family violence are heard within 3 business days. It takes about 7 business days to hear cases about non-urgent repairs. Applications for possession due to danger, damage, or disruption are scheduled for hearing as soon as possible within 4-6 weeks. Possession applications due to unpaid rent are heard in about 6 weeks, and most other applications for possession and renewals are heard within 8-10 weeks.\nFor applications considered urgent under the law, we contact you by text, phone or email within 24-48 hours. At an urgent hearing, only the urgent issues will be dealt with. Non-urgent issues, such as compensation, will be dealt with when there is more time at a later hearing.\nApplications for re-opening (request for a review)\nIf you have submitted a review of an order that allows the Residential Rental Provider (Landlord) to purchase a Warrant of Possession, VCAT will not issue the Warrant until the review hearing is heard.\nIf the Warrant has been issued before the review request was made, VCAT will make an order placing the Warrant on hold until the review hearing is heard. If the Warrant is being executed within 48 hours, you must contact our customer service team on 1300 01 8228 (1300 01 VCAT) and alert us to your request.\nIf the Warrant is executed before an order is made placing the Warrant on hold, this cannot be reversed.\nA copy of this order is sent to all parties and the Police identified on the Warrant.\nIf you or the Police have not received a copy of this order, please contact our customer service team on 1300 01 8228 (1300 01 VCAT)\nIf you are being evicted\nAct now to seek help with alternative housing or get advice on your legal rights. If your rental provider has a warrant of possession from VCAT, the police can make you leave the property. The police will tell you when you need to leave, this may be immediately or they may return (usually within 14 days).\nIf you need help with crisis or emergency housing call 1800 825 955. This is a 24-hour, state-wide, toll-free service.\nVCAT cannot provide legal advice but there are service providers who can give legal advice or information free or low cost\nIf you need someone to talk to, call Lifeline 13 11 14.

We are open Monday to Friday between 8.30am – 5.30pm during office hours. Please note, that if keys are not returned on or before the vacate date, rent will continue to be charged at the daily rate.\n \nPower Connection: We recommend keeping the power connected for three business days after you return your keys. This will allow the final inspection to be completed with the power on. If the power is disconnected, we will need to establish a new connection, which may delay the bond return.\n \nFinal Inspection: We will conduct a final inspection of the property within 3 business days of the keys being returned. You are invited to attend the final inspection. If you would like to attend, please let me know ASAP so I can arrange a suitable time with you.\n \nBond Return: To ensure a speedy return of your bond, please return the property in its original condition, less normal wear and tear. You can expect your bond to be returned within 10 business days. For clarity on property expectations and to expedite the bond return process, please refer to the attached “Move out guide & tips to get your bond back.”\n \nUtility Cancelation: Ensure that you contact all your utility providers to advise your intended vacate date. Any bills or charges incurred after your vacate date will be your responsibility.\n \nCleaning: We kindly ask that you leave the property in a clean and tidy state, as outlined in the rental agreement & as per the in-going condition report. To assist with the cleaning process, we have attached the document labelled “Vacate cleaning guide’’ to help you or your preferred cleaner.\n \nKeys and Property Access: Please ensure that all keys, remotes, and other access devices provided to you are returned to the office and signed back in by your vacate date. Any unreturned or lost items will need to be replaced at your expense. Do not leave keys in the letterbox due to the risk of theft. Renters are responsible for replacing locks and keys if they are stolen from the letterbox. \nIf you have any questions or need clarification on any of the above points, please don't hesitate to reach out.\n \nWarm regards,\nSylvia Hao\nRelationship Manager\nsylvia.hao@areal.com.au\n0420 675 561\nIf you have any feedback regarding my service, please feel free to contact my manager.\nJamie Ong (Head of Property Management) jamie.ong@areal.com.au\nDISCLAIMER & WARNING.

Please provide a clear explanation in writing of how this figure was determined.\nTo avoid any misunderstanding by herself only (Sylvia), I must state plainly that I do not accept or acknowledge this amount as adequate or final.\nScreenshot 2025-07-11 at 11.44.53.png\nRegarding your comment about resolving this matter “as quickly and smoothly as possible,” I am referring to the five Notices of Entry delivered within two days, followed by no one attending any of them. Please provide written evidence from FIXD explaining why these appointments were cancelled or ignored.\nOn the repeated suggestions to terminate my lease early without penalty, why is your agency so determined to propose ending a tenancy I have maintained responsibly? If this is effectively an admission that you cannot fulfill your obligations, stating that openly would be more professional.\nRegarding involving the Owners Corporation: I am aware you would prefer not to accept sole accountability. However, I do not have any dispute with the OC. It appears the delays have mainly resulted from your own processes.If you believe involving the OC is necessary, please share their contact details, as I am considering contacting them directly to discuss whether we should explore a joint complaint regarding your handling of this matter.\nFor the avoidance of doubt, I expect written, itemised clarification of the following:\n    How the $800 figure was calculated.\n    What this amount is intended to cover.\n    Evidence explaining the missed appointments.\n    The reasons for repeated lease termination proposals.\nI will be collecting all relevant records before deciding whether escalation is appropriate.\nI trust you will address these points clearly and in writing, without further delay.\nSincerely,\nChawakorn Kamnuansil\nTenant – Unit 1803\nVCAT Ref: RT252398\nOn Wed, Jul 9, 2025 at 6:39 PM Johnson Tan <johnson.tan@areal.com.au> wrote:\n    Hi Chawakorn,\n     \n    Good evening and hope you're both doing well.\n    I’m following up on my previous email regarding the compensation from the OC.\n     \n    Please know that I’m here to assist and help explore the best possible options for you.\n    At the end of the day, our shared goal is to have the issue resolved as quickly and smoothly as possible.\n     \n    I completely understand your concerns about staying in the property during the repair work.\n    When FIXD inspected the property back in May, the initial estimate for the job duration was over 7 – 10 days.\n    However, due to the delays, the condition might have been deteriorated. Hence, FIXD is unable to provide a timeframe of the work.\n     \n    As I have not yet received a confirmed response from the OC regarding the $800 compensation offer, I would like to outline some options for you to consider:\n     \n        Seek temporary accommodation during the works, and submit a reimbursement claim to the OC, who is ultimately responsible for the leak. While this is a valid option, I must note that we cannot guarantee the outcome of their approval.\n        Early lease termination without penalty. If you feel the property will be uninhabitable during the repairs and would prefer not to take the risk of seeking compensation from the OC, the rental provider is willing to allow you to break the fixed-term lease early with no penalties.\n        If you would like to further escalate this, you can have the OC joined as a party to residential tenancy application at VCAT\n     \n    Please let us know which option you would prefer, or if there’s anything else we can do to support you.\n    Thank you again, and wishing you a pleasant evening.\n     \n    Kind Regards,\n    	Johnson Tan\n    Senior Relationship Manager - Coverage\n    0420 846 041 \n    johnson.tan@areal.com.au\n    03 9818 8991\n    33 Camberwell Road Hawthorn East VIC 3123\n    www.areal.com.au \n    arealbrandmarkgreygreen.png 	web.png facebook.png instagram.png youtube.png linkedin.png\n    Email Banner(600 x 120 px) (1).png\n    DISCLAIMER & WARNING.

Hence, FIXD is unable to provide a timeframe of the work.\n \nAs I have not yet received a confirmed response from the OC regarding the $800 compensation offer, I would like to outline some options for you to consider:\n \n    Seek temporary accommodation during the works, and submit a reimbursement claim to the OC, who is ultimately responsible for the leak. While this is a valid option, I must note that we cannot guarantee the outcome of their approval.\n    Early lease termination without penalty. If you feel the property will be uninhabitable during the repairs and would prefer not to take the risk of seeking compensation from the OC, the rental provider is willing to allow you to break the fixed-term lease early with no penalties.\n    If you would like to further escalate this, you can have the OC joined as a party to residential tenancy application at VCAT\n \nPlease let us know which option you would prefer, or if there’s anything else we can do to support you.\nThank you again, and wishing you a pleasant evening.\n \nKind Regards,\n	Johnson Tan\nSenior Relationship Manager - Coverage\n0420 846 041 \njohnson.tan@areal.com.au\n03 9818 8991\n33 Camberwell Road Hawthorn East VIC 3123\nwww.areal.com.au \narealbrandmarkgreygreen.png 	web.png facebook.png instagram.png youtube.png linkedin.png\nEmail Banner(600 x 120 px) (1).png\nDISCLAIMER & WARNING.

It outlines your non-compliance and contains a final demand for action.\nLet us first establish the facts, based entirely on your own actions and documentation:\n    Your Notices Are Invalid: You deliberately marked """"NO"""" on your own forms, formally declaring no details were attached. This renders them defective under the RTA.\n    You Have Fabricated Evidence: You have repeatedly relied on a non-existent """"tenant-confirmation"""" to support your false narrative.\n    Abdication of Professional Duty: Your notice directs me to seek help from Consumer Affairs Victoria. This is a formal admission of your failure to perform your duties as an agent, attempting to outsource your responsibilities to me.\nAfter 70+ days of this conduct, the direct result of your failures is that one simple, fundamental question remains unanswered. The proposed work is in our only bedroom. Sylvia's unprofessional suggestion to """"stay at a friend's place"""" is not a solution.\nTherefore, a singular, fundamental question requires your immediate attention:\nWhere, precisely, are my roommate and I supposed to live while our bedroom is a work site?\nTo be clear, any refusal of entry based on an unworkable or unreasonable plan—similar to the unhelpful suggestions you have provided in the past—will not be considered a breach on my part. The responsibility to provide a viable, respectful solution rests entirely with you. Consider this carefully.\nI require your clear, written plan for suitable temporary accommodation by 5:00 PM tomorrow, 4 July 2025.\nIf you fail to provide this plan by the deadline, I will, without further notice, file an urgent application with VCAT and a formal complaint with Consumer Affairs Victoria. The complaint will detail the entire pattern of conduct outlined in this email, including your issuance of defective legal documents, fabrication of evidence, and abdication of professional duties.\nYour own documents will form the basis of my submissions.\nChawakorn Kamnuansil\nUnit 1803\nVCAT Ref: RT252398"""

This is now our second attempt to proceed with the repairs. To clarify, all relevant parties – including the OC, FIXD, our agency as the managing agent, and the rental provider are fully committed to commencing and completing the necessary repairs as promptly as possible.\nWe are more than willing to provide any further information the renter may reasonably request to facilitate cooperation. However, we respectfully request that VCAT take into account that we are NOT the party impeding progress.\n \n \nHi Chawakorn,\n \nPlease refer to below response in blue, as I have communicated with FIXD prior to this email.\nI will get the remaining requested details from FIXD, but I can’t guarantee that they will reply within 24 hours.\nGiven that coordinating this repair requires the involvement of multiple parties and significant resources, your cooperation is not only appreciated but essential to ensure the work can proceed without further delay.\nThank you.\n \n \n \nFrom: Chawakorn Kamnuansil <ck.chawakorn@gmail.com>\nSent: Tuesday, 1 July 2025 3:08 PM\nTo: Johnson Tan <johnson.tan@areal.com.au>\nCc: CSV-VCAT-Cases (CSV) <Cases@courts.vic.gov.au>; Areal Property MPM <mpm@email.propertyme.com>; bewty980219@gmail.com\nSubject: Re: RDRV - Case RT252398 - 33 Camberwell Rd, Hawthorn East, VIC, 3123\n \nDear Johnson,\nYour three Section-86 notices, lodged by registered post on 27 June 2025, seek entry at\n08:00 AM on 7, 8 and 9 July—only **12 days’** lead time—and leave the “Details attached” box\nunchecked.  Entry therefore remains conditional.\nSEND WITHIN 24 HOURS\n  1. Contractor legal name, licence number & 24-hour mobile – Pending FIXD’s reply\n  2. Day-by-day work scope (rooms, tasks, time estimates) for the full 7-day schedule The first stage of the repair involves reducing the moisture levels in the affected bedroom, as outlined in the Notice of Entry. During this drying process, the contractor will require daily access to the room in order to monitor and record moisture readings. At this stage, they are unable to provide specific time estimates for this phase, as the duration will depend on how quickly acceptable moisture levels are reached. Once the area has dried sufficiently, they will proceed with the necessary repair work. Please note that because the contractor has not yet assessed the current site conditions in full, they are unable to provide a definitive timeline or scope for the repairs at this time.\n  3. Risk statement – water / power interruptions & noise levels - Pending FIXD’s reply\n  4. Public-liability / PI insurance certificate - Pending FIXD’s reply\n  5. “Tax invoice.pdf” **and** the alleged “tenant-confirmation” screenshot FIXD has been engaged by the Owners Corporation, as the source of the leak originates from a common area. The OC will cover the cost of the repairs once the work is completed. At this stage, FIXD is unable to provide a quote, as they have not yet been able to assess the current site conditions in detail. Could you please clarify what you mean by a “tenant-confirmation screenshot”?\n  6. Daily-rate schedule for drying equipment **plus** written assurance that no\n     “no-access” surcharge will be levied without a Tribunal order As previously mentioned, FIXD is the contractor appointed by the Owners Corporation (OC), and the OC will be covering the cost of the scheduled works. Could you please clarify the relevance of the “daily-rate schedule for drying equipment”? There will be no additional charges incurred, provided FIXD is granted access in accordance with the Notice of Entry and there are no delays caused by restricted access or obstruction to the repair process.\n_No bundle → No entry → Call-out fee remains fictional._\n**Provisional window (if items 1-6 arrive):** **Wed 9 Jul 2025, 15 : 30 – 19 : 00 AEST**\n**Retaliatory warning** Your 27 Jun 15 : 09 email (“…deduct from your bond…”) breaches\ns 264 RTA.

Monitoring will be conducted daily, and any necessary adjustments/cost variations will be communicated promptly. FIXD will not be held responsible for any pre-existing conditions discovered during the course of remediation, including but not limited to structural defects, non-compliant installations, or prior water damage.

If access is not provided as required by our team, extra charges may be applicable to the renters for not providing access. \n     \n    Hi Chawakorn,\n    Since no access was given on 24 June 2025, the contractor has sent us the attached invoice.\n    Please advise whether you would like to pay them directly.\n    Otherwise, the OC will settle with FIXD and on-charge the amount to Lot 1803A, and the rental provider will be seeking reimbursement from you.\n    Please advise, thank you.\n     \n    From: Johnson Tan\n    Sent: Thursday, 26 June 2025 1:04 PM\n    To: Chawakorn Kamnuansil <ck.chawakorn@gmail.com>; CSV-VCAT-Cases (CSV) <Cases@courts.vic.gov.au>\n    Cc: Areal Property MPM <mpm@email.propertyme.com>; bewty980219@gmail.com\n    Subject: RE: RDRV - Case RT252398 - 33 Camberwell Rd, Hawthorn East, VIC, 3123\n     \n    Hi Matthew,\n     \n    Thank you for your call earlier.\n    I have confirmed with the contractor from FIXD Trade Group, the work is now scheduled for 7 July 2025.\n    This is the exact same job scope, which was scheduled for 24 June 2025, but no access was granted that day.\n     \n    The work consists of few stages, and the trade will not be able to send me the timeline until he is back to the office tomorrow.\n    On 7 July 2025, the work will be mould remediation, which is to bring the moisture level in the affected bedroom down.\n    Once the moisture level is at the appropriate level, the damage rectification job will be commenced (wall repair & etc).\n    FIXD Trade Group will need multiple entries for the entire repair work.  \n     \n    Once I have received the timeline from them, I will forward it across so that we are all on the same page.\n     \n    If you need any further details, please feel free to reach out, thanks!\n     \n     \n     \n    From: Chawakorn Kamnuansil <ck.chawakorn@gmail.com>\n    Sent: Thursday, 26 June 2025 11:14 AM\n    To: CSV-VCAT-Cases (CSV) <Cases@courts.vic.gov.au>\n    Cc: Johnson Tan <johnson.tan@areal.com.au>; Areal Property MPM <mpm@email.propertyme.com>; bewty980219@gmail.com\n    Subject: Re: RDRV - Case RT252398 - 33 Camberwell Rd, Hawthorn East, VIC, 3123\n     \n    Dear Matthew,\n    I just received your email about closing my case and I'm quite confused. I thought getting a repair date was just the beginning of solving my problems, not the end.\n    **The key issues I still need help with are:**\n    - Compensation for 70+ days of paying full rent for an unusable bedroom\n    - Where to stay during repairs (the agency hasn't provided any solution for this yet)\n    - This has now affected my studies - my college contacted me this week about urgent matters\n    **I don't understand - does getting a repair date mean I can't ask about these other problems anymore?**\n    Thank you so much for arranging the July 7th repair after you contacted them. It's amazing they could suddenly arrange it after saying they needed 6-7 business days when I was asking, and I'd already waited over two months.\n    I also wanted to mention that I haven't been able to confirm access for the repairs yet because the agency hasn't answered any of my previous questions about what exactly will happen during the repairs or what solutions they'll provide. From what I understand, my flatmate and I will need to leave our rooms during the work, which is quite a big decision that affects both our daily lives directly. I don't think it makes sense for me to confirm anything when I haven't received any information about the details or arrangements.\n    I'm very sorry if I'm completely misunderstanding how this process works. As an international student who has never dealt with anything like this before, I realize I probably don't understand what VCAT can and cannot help with. I was hoping you might be able to guide me about what's reasonable to expect, but I understand if I'm asking for things that aren't part of your role.\n    Should I just accept whatever happens with the repairs and forget about the past 70+ days and other problems? I don't want to cause trouble, but it doesn't feel right to just forget everything that happened.\n    I'm quite overwhelmed and honestly don't know what to do about the compensation and accommodation issues. Could you please help me understand if there are options to address these concerns even if the repairs get scheduled?\n    I hope it's okay to communicate in writing as phone conversations are difficult for me with serious matters. I don't have friends or family here who understand these problems, so I'm trying to figure everything out alone.\n    Thank you for your patience with me.\n    Thank you,\n    Chawakorn Kamnuansil\n     \n    ในวันที่ พฤ. 26 มิ.ย. 2025 เวลา 10:28 CSV-VCAT-Cases (CSV) <Cases@courts.vic.gov.au> เขียนว่า:\n        Good afternoon\n         \n        I understand from the below correspondence that a set of actions has been agreed to resolve this matter.\n         \n        I will proceed to strike this matter out with the right of the applicant to request a reinstatement of the application if required.\n         \n        Chawakorn and Podjana if you object to this please contact me by 1:00pm today on 1300-01-7378.\n         \n        Regards,\n        Matthew T.\n        Resolution Coordinator\n        Cases@courts.vic.gov.au\n         \n        	\n         \n        www.rdrv.vic.gov.au\n         \n        1300-01-7378 (1300-01-RDRV)\n         \n        55 King Street, Melbourne VIC 3000\n         \n        RDRV is an appropriate dispute resolution and case management service provided by VCAT.\n                              \n          RDRV acknowledges the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the Traditional Owners and custodians of the land and waterways upon which our lives depend.

This is now our second attempt to proceed with the repairs. To clarify, all relevant parties – including the OC, FIXD, our agency as the managing agent, and the rental provider are fully committed to commencing and completing the necessary repairs as promptly as possible.\nWe are more than willing to provide any further information the renter may reasonably request to facilitate cooperation. However, we respectfully request that VCAT take into account that we are NOT the party impeding progress.\n \n \nHi Chawakorn,\n \nPlease refer to below response in blue, as I have communicated with FIXD prior to this email.\nI will get the remaining requested details from FIXD, but I can’t guarantee that they will reply within 24 hours.\nGiven that coordinating this repair requires the involvement of multiple parties and significant resources, your cooperation is not only appreciated but essential to ensure the work can proceed without further delay.\nThank you.\n \n \nKind Regards,\n	Johnson Tan\nSenior Relationship Manager - Coverage\n0420 846 041 \njohnson.tan@areal.com.au\n03 9818 8991\n33 Camberwell Road Hawthorn East VIC 3123\nwww.areal.com.au \narealbrandmarkgreygreen.png 	web.png facebook.png instagram.png youtube.png linkedin.png\nEmail Banner(600 x 120 px) (1).png\nDISCLAIMER & WARNING.

Entry therefore remains conditional.\nSEND WITHIN 24 HOURS\n  1. Contractor legal name, licence number & 24-hour mobile – Pending FIXD’s reply\n  2. Day-by-day work scope (rooms, tasks, time estimates) for the full 7-day schedule The first stage of the repair involves reducing the moisture levels in the affected bedroom, as outlined in the Notice of Entry. During this drying process, the contractor will require daily access to the room in order to monitor and record moisture readings. At this stage, they are unable to provide specific time estimates for this phase, as the duration will depend on how quickly acceptable moisture levels are reached. Once the area has dried sufficiently, they will proceed with the necessary repair work. Please note that because the contractor has not yet assessed the current site conditions in full, they are unable to provide a definitive timeline or scope for the repairs at this time.\n  3. Risk statement – water / power interruptions & noise levels - Pending FIXD’s reply\n  4. Public-liability / PI insurance certificate - Pending FIXD’s reply\n  5. “Tax invoice.pdf” **and** the alleged “tenant-confirmation” screenshot FIXD has been engaged by the Owners Corporation, as the source of the leak originates from a common area. The OC will cover the cost of the repairs once the work is completed. At this stage, FIXD is unable to provide a quote, as they have not yet been able to assess the current site conditions in detail. Could you please clarify what you mean by a “tenant-confirmation screenshot”?\n  6. Daily-rate schedule for drying equipment **plus** written assurance that no\n     “no-access” surcharge will be levied without a Tribunal order As previously mentioned, FIXD is the contractor appointed by the Owners Corporation (OC), and the OC will be covering the cost of the scheduled works. Could you please clarify the relevance of the “daily-rate schedule for drying equipment”? There will be no additional charges incurred, provided FIXD is granted access in accordance with the Notice of Entry and there are no delays caused by restricted access or obstruction to the repair process.\n_No bundle → No entry → Call-out fee remains fictional._\n**Provisional window (if items 1-6 arrive):** **Wed 9 Jul 2025, 15 : 30 – 19 : 00 AEST**\n**Retaliatory warning** Your 27 Jun 15 : 09 email (“…deduct from your bond…”) breaches\ns 264 RTA.

However, the length of drying time may vary depending on external factors such as weather conditions and moisture content. FIXD is not responsible for delays in drying due to uncontrollable factors. Monitoring will be conducted daily, and any necessary adjustments/cost variations will be communicated promptly. FIXD will not be held responsible for any pre-existing conditions discovered during the course of remediation, including but not limited to structural defects, non-compliant installations, or prior water damage. Any discoveries will be communicated to the insured, and additional works may be required outside the scope of this project.\n    We cannot provide a timeline as per your request due to the existing site constraints and nature of the damages. \n    Please note, once drying equipment is on-site, it is charged per day. If access is not provided as required by our team, extra charges may be applicable to the renters for not providing access. \n     \n    Hi Chawakorn,\n    Since no access was given on 24 June 2025, the contractor has sent us the attached invoice.\n    Please advise whether you would like to pay them directly.\n    Otherwise, the OC will settle with FIXD and on-charge the amount to Lot 1803A, and the rental provider will be seeking reimbursement from you.\n    Please advise, thank you.\n     \n    From: Johnson Tan\n    Sent: Thursday, 26 June 2025 1:04 PM\n    To: Chawakorn Kamnuansil <ck.chawakorn@gmail.com>; CSV-VCAT-Cases (CSV) <Cases@courts.vic.gov.au>\n    Cc: Areal Property MPM <mpm@email.propertyme.com>; bewty980219@gmail.com\n    Subject: RE: RDRV - Case RT252398 - 33 Camberwell Rd, Hawthorn East, VIC, 3123\n     \n    Hi Matthew,\n     \n    Thank you for your call earlier.\n    I have confirmed with the contractor from FIXD Trade Group, the work is now scheduled for 7 July 2025.\n    This is the exact same job scope, which was scheduled for 24 June 2025, but no access was granted that day.\n     \n    The work consists of few stages, and the trade will not be able to send me the timeline until he is back to the office tomorrow.\n    On 7 July 2025, the work will be mould remediation, which is to bring the moisture level in the affected bedroom down.\n    Once the moisture level is at the appropriate level, the damage rectification job will be commenced (wall repair & etc).\n    FIXD Trade Group will need multiple entries for the entire repair work.  \n     \n    Once I have received the timeline from them, I will forward it across so that we are all on the same page.\n     \n    If you need any further details, please feel free to reach out, thanks!\n     \n     \n     \n    From: Chawakorn Kamnuansil <ck.chawakorn@gmail.com>\n    Sent: Thursday, 26 June 2025 11:14 AM\n    To: CSV-VCAT-Cases (CSV) <Cases@courts.vic.gov.au>\n    Cc: Johnson Tan <johnson.tan@areal.com.au>; Areal Property MPM <mpm@email.propertyme.com>; bewty980219@gmail.com\n    Subject: Re: RDRV - Case RT252398 - 33 Camberwell Rd, Hawthorn East, VIC, 3123\n     \n    Dear Matthew,\n    I just received your email about closing my case and I'm quite confused. I thought getting a repair date was just the beginning of solving my problems, not the end.\n    **The key issues I still need help with are:**\n    - Compensation for 70+ days of paying full rent for an unusable bedroom\n    - Where to stay during repairs (the agency hasn't provided any solution for this yet)\n    - This has now affected my studies - my college contacted me this week about urgent matters\n    **I don't understand - does getting a repair date mean I can't ask about these other problems anymore?**\n    Thank you so much for arranging the July 7th repair after you contacted them. It's amazing they could suddenly arrange it after saying they needed 6-7 business days when I was asking, and I'd already waited over two months.\n    I also wanted to mention that I haven't been able to confirm access for the repairs yet because the agency hasn't answered any of my previous questions about what exactly will happen during the repairs or what solutions they'll provide. From what I understand, my flatmate and I will need to leave our rooms during the work, which is quite a big decision that affects both our daily lives directly. I don't think it makes sense for me to confirm anything when I haven't received any information about the details or arrangements.\n    I'm very sorry if I'm completely misunderstanding how this process works. As an international student who has never dealt with anything like this before, I realize I probably don't understand what VCAT can and cannot help with. I was hoping you might be able to guide me about what's reasonable to expect, but I understand if I'm asking for things that aren't part of your role.\n    Should I just accept whatever happens with the repairs and forget about the past 70+ days and other problems? I don't want to cause trouble, but it doesn't feel right to just forget everything that happened.\n    I'm quite overwhelmed and honestly don't know what to do about the compensation and accommodation issues. Could you please help me understand if there are options to address these concerns even if the repairs get scheduled?\n    I hope it's okay to communicate in writing as phone conversations are difficult for me with serious matters. I don't have friends or family here who understand these problems, so I'm trying to figure everything out alone.\n    Thank you for your patience with me.\n    Thank you,\n    Chawakorn Kamnuansil\n     \n    ในวันที่ พฤ. 26 มิ.ย. 2025 เวลา 10:28 CSV-VCAT-Cases (CSV) <Cases@courts.vic.gov.au> เขียนว่า:\n        Good afternoon\n         \n        I understand from the below correspondence that a set of actions has been agreed to resolve this matter.\n         \n        I will proceed to strike this matter out with the right of the applicant to request a reinstatement of the application if required.\n         \n        Chawakorn and Podjana if you object to this please contact me by 1:00pm today on 1300-01-7378.\n         \n        Regards,\n        Matthew T.\n        Resolution Coordinator\n        Cases@courts.vic.gov.au\n         \n        	\n         \n        www.rdrv.vic.gov.au\n         \n        1300-01-7378 (1300-01-RDRV)\n         \n        55 King Street, Melbourne VIC 3000\n         \n        RDRV is an appropriate dispute resolution and case management service provided by VCAT.\n                              \n          RDRV acknowledges the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the Traditional Owners and custodians of the land and waterways upon which our lives depend.

However, the length of drying time may vary depending on external factors such as weather conditions and moisture content. FIXD is not responsible for delays in drying due to uncontrollable factors. Monitoring will be conducted daily, and any necessary adjustments/cost variations will be communicated promptly. FIXD will not be held responsible for any pre-existing conditions discovered during the course of remediation, including but not limited to structural defects, non-compliant installations, or prior water damage. Any discoveries will be communicated to the insured, and additional works may be required outside the scope of this project.\n    We cannot provide a timeline as per your request due to the existing site constraints and nature of the damages. \n    Please note, once drying equipment is on-site, it is charged per day. If access is not provided as required by our team, extra charges may be applicable to the renters for not providing access. \n     \n    Hi Chawakorn,\n    Since no access was given on 24 June 2025, the contractor has sent us the attached invoice.\n    Please advise whether you would like to pay them directly.\n    Otherwise, the OC will settle with FIXD and on-charge the amount to Lot 1803A, and the rental provider will be seeking reimbursement from you.\n    Please advise, thank you.\n     \n    From: Johnson Tan\n    Sent: Thursday, 26 June 2025 1:04 PM\n    To: Chawakorn Kamnuansil <ck.chawakorn@gmail.com>; CSV-VCAT-Cases (CSV) <Cases@courts.vic.gov.au>\n    Cc: Areal Property MPM <mpm@email.propertyme.com>; bewty980219@gmail.com\n    Subject: RE: RDRV - Case RT252398 - 33 Camberwell Rd, Hawthorn East, VIC, 3123\n     \n    Hi Matthew,\n     \n    Thank you for your call earlier.\n    I have confirmed with the contractor from FIXD Trade Group, the work is now scheduled for 7 July 2025.\n    This is the exact same job scope, which was scheduled for 24 June 2025, but no access was granted that day.\n     \n    The work consists of few stages, and the trade will not be able to send me the timeline until he is back to the office tomorrow.\n    On 7 July 2025, the work will be mould remediation, which is to bring the moisture level in the affected bedroom down.\n    Once the moisture level is at the appropriate level, the damage rectification job will be commenced (wall repair & etc).\n    FIXD Trade Group will need multiple entries for the entire repair work.  \n     \n    Once I have received the timeline from them, I will forward it across so that we are all on the same page.\n     \n    If you need any further details, please feel free to reach out, thanks!\n     \n     \n     \n    From: Chawakorn Kamnuansil <ck.chawakorn@gmail.com>\n    Sent: Thursday, 26 June 2025 11:14 AM\n    To: CSV-VCAT-Cases (CSV) <Cases@courts.vic.gov.au>\n    Cc: Johnson Tan <johnson.tan@areal.com.au>; Areal Property MPM <mpm@email.propertyme.com>; bewty980219@gmail.com\n    Subject: Re: RDRV - Case RT252398 - 33 Camberwell Rd, Hawthorn East, VIC, 3123\n     \n    Dear Matthew,\n    I just received your email about closing my case and I'm quite confused. I thought getting a repair date was just the beginning of solving my problems, not the end.\n    **The key issues I still need help with are:**\n    - Compensation for 70+ days of paying full rent for an unusable bedroom\n    - Where to stay during repairs (the agency hasn't provided any solution for this yet)\n    - This has now affected my studies - my college contacted me this week about urgent matters\n    **I don't understand - does getting a repair date mean I can't ask about these other problems anymore?**\n    Thank you so much for arranging the July 7th repair after you contacted them. It's amazing they could suddenly arrange it after saying they needed 6-7 business days when I was asking, and I'd already waited over two months.\n    I also wanted to mention that I haven't been able to confirm access for the repairs yet because the agency hasn't answered any of my previous questions about what exactly will happen during the repairs or what solutions they'll provide. From what I understand, my flatmate and I will need to leave our rooms during the work, which is quite a big decision that affects both our daily lives directly. I don't think it makes sense for me to confirm anything when I haven't received any information about the details or arrangements.\n    I'm very sorry if I'm completely misunderstanding how this process works. As an international student who has never dealt with anything like this before, I realize I probably don't understand what VCAT can and cannot help with. I was hoping you might be able to guide me about what's reasonable to expect, but I understand if I'm asking for things that aren't part of your role.\n    Should I just accept whatever happens with the repairs and forget about the past 70+ days and other problems? I don't want to cause trouble, but it doesn't feel right to just forget everything that happened.\n    I'm quite overwhelmed and honestly don't know what to do about the compensation and accommodation issues. Could you please help me understand if there are options to address these concerns even if the repairs get scheduled?\n    I hope it's okay to communicate in writing as phone conversations are difficult for me with serious matters. I don't have friends or family here who understand these problems, so I'm trying to figure everything out alone.\n    Thank you for your patience with me.\n    Thank you,\n    Chawakorn Kamnuansil\n     \n    ในวันที่ พฤ. 26 มิ.ย. 2025 เวลา 10:28 CSV-VCAT-Cases (CSV) <Cases@courts.vic.gov.au> เขียนว่า:\n        Good afternoon\n         \n        I understand from the below correspondence that a set of actions has been agreed to resolve this matter.\n         \n        I will proceed to strike this matter out with the right of the applicant to request a reinstatement of the application if required.\n         \n        Chawakorn and Podjana if you object to this please contact me by 1:00pm today on 1300-01-7378.\n         \n        Regards,\n        Matthew T.\n        Resolution Coordinator\n        Cases@courts.vic.gov.au\n         \n        	\n         \n        www.rdrv.vic.gov.au\n         \n        1300-01-7378 (1300-01-RDRV)\n         \n        55 King Street, Melbourne VIC 3000\n         \n        RDRV is an appropriate dispute resolution and case management service provided by VCAT.\n                              \n          RDRV acknowledges the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the Traditional Owners and custodians of the land and waterways upon which our lives depend.

However, the length of drying time may vary depending on external factors such as weather conditions and moisture content. FIXD is not responsible for delays in drying due to uncontrollable factors. Monitoring will be conducted daily, and any necessary adjustments/cost variations will be communicated promptly. FIXD will not be held responsible for any pre-existing conditions discovered during the course of remediation, including but not limited to structural defects, non-compliant installations, or prior water damage. Any discoveries will be communicated to the insured, and additional works may be required outside the scope of this project.\nWe cannot provide a timeline as per your request due to the existing site constraints and nature of the damages. \nPlease note, once drying equipment is on-site, it is charged per day. If access is not provided as required by our team, extra charges may be applicable to the renters for not providing access. \n \nHi Chawakorn,\nSince no access was given on 24 June 2025, the contractor has sent us the attached invoice.\nPlease advise whether you would like to pay them directly.\nOtherwise, the OC will settle with FIXD and on-charge the amount to Lot 1803A, and the rental provider will be seeking reimbursement from you.\nPlease advise, thank you.\n \nFrom: Johnson Tan\nSent: Thursday, 26 June 2025 1:04 PM\nTo: Chawakorn Kamnuansil <ck.chawakorn@gmail.com>; CSV-VCAT-Cases (CSV) <Cases@courts.vic.gov.au>\nCc: Areal Property MPM <mpm@email.propertyme.com>; bewty980219@gmail.com\nSubject: RE: RDRV - Case RT252398 - 33 Camberwell Rd, Hawthorn East, VIC, 3123\n \nHi Matthew,\n \nThank you for your call earlier.\nI have confirmed with the contractor from FIXD Trade Group, the work is now scheduled for 7 July 2025.\nThis is the exact same job scope, which was scheduled for 24 June 2025, but no access was granted that day.\n \nThe work consists of few stages, and the trade will not be able to send me the timeline until he is back to the office tomorrow.\nOn 7 July 2025, the work will be mould remediation, which is to bring the moisture level in the affected bedroom down.\nOnce the moisture level is at the appropriate level, the damage rectification job will be commenced (wall repair & etc).\nFIXD Trade Group will need multiple entries for the entire repair work.  \n \nOnce I have received the timeline from them, I will forward it across so that we are all on the same page.\n \nIf you need any further details, please feel free to reach out, thanks!\n \n \n \nFrom: Chawakorn Kamnuansil <ck.chawakorn@gmail.com>\nSent: Thursday, 26 June 2025 11:14 AM\nTo: CSV-VCAT-Cases (CSV) <Cases@courts.vic.gov.au>\nCc: Johnson Tan <johnson.tan@areal.com.au>; Areal Property MPM <mpm@email.propertyme.com>; bewty980219@gmail.com\nSubject: Re: RDRV - Case RT252398 - 33 Camberwell Rd, Hawthorn East, VIC, 3123\n \nDear Matthew,\nI just received your email about closing my case and I'm quite confused.

However, the length of drying time may vary depending on external factors such as weather conditions and moisture content. FIXD is not responsible for delays in drying due to uncontrollable factors. Monitoring will be conducted daily, and any necessary adjustments/cost variations will be communicated promptly. FIXD will not be held responsible for any pre-existing conditions discovered during the course of remediation, including but not limited to structural defects, non-compliant installations, or prior water damage. Any discoveries will be communicated to the insured, and additional works may be required outside the scope of this project.\nWe cannot provide a timeline as per your request due to the existing site constraints and nature of the damages. \nPlease note, once drying equipment is on-site, it is charged per day. If access is not provided as required by our team, extra charges may be applicable to the renters for not providing access. \n \nHi Chawakorn,\nSince no access was given on 24 June 2025, the contractor has sent us the attached invoice.\nPlease advise whether you would like to pay them directly.\nOtherwise, the OC will settle with FIXD and on-charge the amount to Lot 1803A, and the rental provider will be seeking reimbursement from you.\nPlease advise, thank you.\n \nKind Regards,\n	Johnson Tan\nSenior Relationship Manager - Coverage\n0420 846 041 \njohnson.tan@areal.com.au\n03 9818 8991\n33 Camberwell Road Hawthorn East VIC 3123\nwww.areal.com.au \narealbrandmarkgreygreen.png 	web.png facebook.png instagram.png youtube.png linkedin.png\nEmail Banner(600 x 120 px) (1).png\nDISCLAIMER & WARNING.

I thought getting a repair date was just the beginning of solving my problems, not the end.\n**The key issues I still need help with are:**\n- Compensation for 70+ days of paying full rent for an unusable bedroom\n- Where to stay during repairs (the agency hasn't provided any solution for this yet)\n- This has now affected my studies - my college contacted me this week about urgent matters\n**I don't understand - does getting a repair date mean I can't ask about these other problems anymore?**\nThank you so much for arranging the July 7th repair after you contacted them. It's amazing they could suddenly arrange it after saying they needed 6-7 business days when I was asking, and I'd already waited over two months.\nI also wanted to mention that I haven't been able to confirm access for the repairs yet because the agency hasn't answered any of my previous questions about what exactly will happen during the repairs or what solutions they'll provide. From what I understand, my flatmate and I will need to leave our rooms during the work, which is quite a big decision that affects both our daily lives directly. I don't think it makes sense for me to confirm anything when I haven't received any information about the details or arrangements.\nI'm very sorry if I'm completely misunderstanding how this process works. As an international student who has never dealt with anything like this before, I realize I probably don't understand what VCAT can and cannot help with. I was hoping you might be able to guide me about what's reasonable to expect, but I understand if I'm asking for things that aren't part of your role.\nShould I just accept whatever happens with the repairs and forget about the past 70+ days and other problems?

I thought getting a repair date was just the beginning of solving my problems, not the end.\n**The key issues I still need help with are:**\n- Compensation for 70+ days of paying full rent for an unusable bedroom\n- Where to stay during repairs (the agency hasn't provided any solution for this yet)\n- This has now affected my studies - my college contacted me this week about urgent matters\n**I don't understand - does getting a repair date mean I can't ask about these other problems anymore?**\nThank you so much for arranging the July 7th repair after you contacted them. It's amazing they could suddenly arrange it after saying they needed 6-7 business days when I was asking, and I'd already waited over two months.\nI also wanted to mention that I haven't been able to confirm access for the repairs yet because the agency hasn't answered any of my previous questions about what exactly will happen during the repairs or what solutions they'll provide. From what I understand, my flatmate and I will need to leave our rooms during the work, which is quite a big decision that affects both our daily lives directly. I don't think it makes sense for me to confirm anything when I haven't received any information about the details or arrangements.\nI'm very sorry if I'm completely misunderstanding how this process works. As an international student who has never dealt with anything like this before, I realize I probably don't understand what VCAT can and cannot help with. I was hoping you might be able to guide me about what's reasonable to expect, but I understand if I'm asking for things that aren't part of your role.\nShould I just accept whatever happens with the repairs and forget about the past 70+ days and other problems? I don't want to cause trouble, but it doesn't feel right to just forget everything that happened.\nI'm quite overwhelmed and honestly don't know what to do about the compensation and accommodation issues. Could you please help me understand if there are options to address these concerns even if the repairs get scheduled?\nI hope it's okay to communicate in writing as phone conversations are difficult for me with serious matters. I don't have friends or family here who understand these problems, so I'm trying to figure everything out alone.\nThank you for your patience with me.\nThank you,\nChawakorn Kamnuansil\nในวันที่ พฤ. 26 มิ.ย. 2025 เวลา 10:28 CSV-VCAT-Cases (CSV) <Cases@courts.vic.gov.au> เขียนว่า:\n    Good afternoon\n     \n    I understand from the below correspondence that a set of actions has been agreed to resolve this matter.\n     \n    I will proceed to strike this matter out with the right of the applicant to request a reinstatement of the application if required.\n     \n    Chawakorn and Podjana if you object to this please contact me by 1:00pm today on 1300-01-7378.\n     \n    Regards,\n    Matthew T.\n    Resolution Coordinator\n    Cases@courts.vic.gov.au\n     \n    	\n     \n    www.rdrv.vic.gov.au\n     \n    1300-01-7378 (1300-01-RDRV)\n     \n    55 King Street, Melbourne VIC 3000\n     \n    RDRV is an appropriate dispute resolution and case management service provided by VCAT.\n                          \n      RDRV acknowledges the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the Traditional Owners and custodians of the land and waterways upon which our lives depend.

They mentioned they rang both the intercom and your mobile but unfortunately couldn’t get through.\n    After waiting for approximately an hour, they had no choice but to leave the building. As a result, they will need to charge the OC for the call-out and arrange a new time for the job to be completed.\n    Our primary concern is to ensure everything is okay on your end, especially as we haven’t heard from you today. \n    Please let us know that you're safe when you get a moment, and we’ll work with the OC to coordinate a new appointment as soon as possible.\n    Johnson Tan\n    Senior Relationship Manager\n     \n    M 0420 846 041 \n    E johnson.tan@areal.com.au\n    P 03 9818 8991\n    A 33 Camberwell Road Hawthorn East VIC 3123\n             \n    On 23/06/2025 5:51 PM, MPM@email.propertyme.com wrote:\n        Hi Chawakorn, \n        Thank you for your reply. I want to start by sincerely apologising for the inconvenience and frustration this ongoing issue has caused you. I truly understand how disruptive this must be, and I appreciate your continued patience throughout.\n        After reviewing the communication trail, I want to clarify that the source of the leak originates from a common area of the building, which falls under the Owners Corporation's (OC) responsibility. As a result, all scheduling and repair works need to be coordinated through them. Unfortunately, this has contributed to the delays, and I understand how frustrating that can be.\n        To address your first question: Sylvia did send an email on 18 June 2025 to both you and Podjana once the OC confirmed the appointment details. I’ve attached a screenshot of that email for your reference. It’s possible it was missed, but I’m glad to hear that you’ll be able to provide access tomorrow.\n        Regarding alternative accommodation, it was my understanding that the agreed $800 compensation was intended to help offset those costs. If I’ve misunderstood or missed anything, please do let me know—there’s been a lot of emails, and I want to ensure nothing important is overlooked. The amount will be set as rent credit once the repair is commenced. \n        Again, I truly empathise with your situation. From what I’ve seen, Sylvia has been doing her utmost to keep communication flowing between all parties involved—yourself, the rental provider, the OC, and their plumber. Unfortunately, her ability to act is limited when the responsible party is not as responsive as we would hope.\n        Please rest assured that we will continue to follow up closely and advocate for this to be resolved as quickly as possible.\n        Johnson Tan\n        Senior Relationship Manager\n         \n        M 0420 846 041 \n        E johnson.tan@areal.com.au\n        P 03 9818 8991\n        A 33 Camberwell Road Hawthorn East VIC 3123\n                 \n        On 23/06/2025 3:38 PM, Chawakorn Kamnuansil <ck.chawakorn@gmail.com> wrote:\n            Dear Johnson,\n            Thank you for your message. And honestly, I’m relieved to hear from someone new, because I don’t feel that Sylvia Hao ever fully understood what I’ve been trying to say from the start.\n            Happy holiday to Sylvia — I hope she’s having a relaxing break. I wish I could take one too under the current circumstances.\n            I kindly ask you to take a moment to review my past emails. At no point did I confirm that I agreed to the works or gave consent to proceed. In fact, I’ve repeatedly asked Sylvia for proper information and clarification, which I never received. The only thing I said was that I might be out of touch — which I clearly explained was because I needed a break from all this due to how much stress it had caused me. And now, after several days of silence, I suddenly receive a reminder that the works are happening tomorrow?\n            I have no idea what’s going to happen to me tomorrow.\n            You’re asking me to provide access for something I was never truly consulted on. I was not given 14 days’ notice. And more importantly — where do you actually expect me to stay? I just paid $2,825 in rent. I have no money for a second place. I can’t share a bedroom with my co-tenant. And no one from your office, including Sylvia, has ever addressed that properly.\n            If this is the agency’s internal policy — to carry out major internal works while offering no accommodation or practical alternatives to the tenant — then please confirm that to me clearly. It would actually be helpful for me to have that confirmed, because I have now submitted this matter to VCAT and am preparing to provide a complete record of what’s happened.\n            Again, I am not refusing access. I am simply asking a question that no one has answered: where am I supposed to stay?\n            Also, please do not attempt to contact me by phone. I will not answer any calls. All communication must be in writing by email, as phone calls cannot be recorded or documented for evidence purposes.\n            Regards,\n            Chawakorn Kamnuansil\n            On Mon, 23 Jun 2025 at 14:35, Johnson Tan - Areal Property Hawthorn (MPM) <MPM@email.propertyme.com> wrote:\n                agent image	\n                	\n                Hi Chawakorn,\n                Good afternoon and hope you are well.\n                Sylvia is currently on leave and will be back on 7 July. \n                Just a quick reminder that the remediation work will be commenced on tomorrow (24 June) at 8:30AM. \n                Please ensure you will be able to provide access for the trade. \n                Thank you very much! \n                Johnson Tan\n                Senior Relationship Manager\n                 \n                M 0420 846 041 \n                E johnson.tan@areal.com.au\n                P 03 9818 8991\n                A 33 Camberwell Road Hawthorn East VIC 3123\n                         \n                On 16/06/2025 11:51 AM, MPM@email.propertyme.comwrote:\n                    Hi Chawakorn,\n                    Thanks so much for checking in and for confirming.\n                    We’re currently following up with the Owners Corporation to lock in the repair schedule, and we’ll send through an update as soon as we hear back from their team.\n                    If anything comes through today, I’ll definitely pass it on.\n                    Thanks again for your patience and understanding — we’re getting closer.\n                    Warm regards,\n                    Sylvia Hao\n                    Relationship Manager\n                     \n                    M   0420 675 561\n                    P    03 9818 8991\n                    A    33 Camberwell Road, Hawthorn East VIC 3123\n                            \n                    On 16/06/2025 4:37 AM, Chawakorn Kamnuansil <ck.chawakorn@gmail.com> wrote:\n                        just wondering if there’s any update on the general repair days or schedule?\n                        if you have anything rough before 9:30 monday, feel free to send it through, just so I can sort out what to do\n                        not a big deal either way, just thought I’d check\n                        i’ll probably just reply before 12:00 like you mentioned\n                        might be out of touch after that\n                        thanks\n                        chawakorn\n                        On Fri, 13 Jun 2025 at 17:22, Sylvia Hao - Areal Property Hawthorn (MPM) <MPM@email.propertyme.com> wrote:\n                            agent image	\n                            	\n                            Dear Chawakorn,\n                            I hope you're well, and thank you again for your continued engagement regarding the repair matter.\n                            Following instructions from the rental provider, we are now arranging to proceed with the required repairs to the water-damaged wall and flooring.

That silence, in itself, said a great deal.\n                                        In addition, the questions I have raised — including the breakdown of the $800 figure, the repair timeline, and the specific conditions affecting my tenancy — have still not been addressed in writing. These are matters that should be readily available to your team, and I find it concerning that they remain unanswered despite repeated and reasonable requests.\n                                        I’ve done my best to remain cooperative, flexible, and patient, even though I am the one living with the ongoing impact. But based on the way this has been handled, I no longer believe that an in-person meeting will lead to any meaningful resolution — especially when my time and concerns have not been respected.\n                                        Accordingly, I will not be attending any further meetings. From this point forward, I will only continue this matter through formal written communication.

I'm an international student living in this unit, and I’m not very familiar with all the repair or legal processes in Melbourne, but I’m really trying to follow everything the right way.\nRecently I heard that a contractor came, but I didn’t receive any clear message or schedule about what was going to happen. I didn’t know if they were coming just to check or to actually repair the problem. I also wasn’t told if I needed to leave the room or prepare anything. Because I live in the area that needs repair, this kind of information is really important for me to get ready properly.\nTo try my best, I stayed up the whole night before working on documents and preparing everything I thought might be useful for this case. I finished around 5 AM. I was trying to be responsible and respectful of the process. Unfortunately, I was so tired that I accidentally fell asleep in the morning and didn’t hear anything when the contractor came. It wasn’t on purpose, and I really didn’t mean to miss them.\nI never refused access. I just didn’t get clear communication about the visit and couldn’t prepare for it properly. I still really want the repair to be done and I’m happy to reschedule, as long as I know in advance what will happen and what I need to do.\nPlease continue with the case. The problem hasn’t been fixed yet and I’m hoping we can move forward.\nKind regards,\nChawakorn Kamnuansil\nck.chawakorn@gmail.com\n+61 449 962 645\nในวันที่ อ. 24 มิ.ย. 2025 เวลา 12:00 CSV-VCAT-Cases (CSV) <Cases@courts.vic.gov.au> เขียนว่า:\n    Good Morning\n    My name is Matthew and I am part of the Early Resolution Team at Rental Dispute Resolution Victoria (RDRV).

They mentioned they rang both the intercom and your mobile but unfortunately couldn’t get through.\nAfter waiting for approximately an hour, they had no choice but to leave the building. As a result, they will need to charge the OC for the call-out and arrange a new time for the job to be completed.\nOur primary concern is to ensure everything is okay on your end, especially as we haven’t heard from you today. \nPlease let us know that you're safe when you get a moment, and we’ll work with the OC to coordinate a new appointment as soon as possible.\nJohnson Tan\nSenior Relationship Manager\n \nM 0420 846 041 \nE johnson.tan@areal.com.au\nP 03 9818 8991\nA 33 Camberwell Road Hawthorn East VIC 3123\n         \nOn 23/06/2025 5:51 PM, MPM@email.propertyme.com wrote:\n    Hi Chawakorn, \n    Thank you for your reply. I want to start by sincerely apologising for the inconvenience and frustration this ongoing issue has caused you. I truly understand how disruptive this must be, and I appreciate your continued patience throughout.\n    After reviewing the communication trail, I want to clarify that the source of the leak originates from a common area of the building, which falls under the Owners Corporation's (OC) responsibility. As a result, all scheduling and repair works need to be coordinated through them. Unfortunately, this has contributed to the delays, and I understand how frustrating that can be.\n    To address your first question: Sylvia did send an email on 18 June 2025 to both you and Podjana once the OC confirmed the appointment details. I’ve attached a screenshot of that email for your reference. It’s possible it was missed, but I’m glad to hear that you’ll be able to provide access tomorrow.\n    Regarding alternative accommodation, it was my understanding that the agreed $800 compensation was intended to help offset those costs. If I’ve misunderstood or missed anything, please do let me know—there’s been a lot of emails, and I want to ensure nothing important is overlooked. The amount will be set as rent credit once the repair is commenced. \n    Again, I truly empathise with your situation. From what I’ve seen, Sylvia has been doing her utmost to keep communication flowing between all parties involved—yourself, the rental provider, the OC, and their plumber. Unfortunately, her ability to act is limited when the responsible party is not as responsive as we would hope.\n    Please rest assured that we will continue to follow up closely and advocate for this to be resolved as quickly as possible.\n    Johnson Tan\n    Senior Relationship Manager\n     \n    M 0420 846 041 \n    E johnson.tan@areal.com.au\n    P 03 9818 8991\n    A 33 Camberwell Road Hawthorn East VIC 3123\n             \n    On 23/06/2025 3:38 PM, Chawakorn Kamnuansil <ck.chawakorn@gmail.com> wrote:\n        Dear Johnson,\n        Thank you for your message. And honestly, I’m relieved to hear from someone new, because I don’t feel that Sylvia Hao ever fully understood what I’ve been trying to say from the start.\n        Happy holiday to Sylvia — I hope she’s having a relaxing break. I wish I could take one too under the current circumstances.\n        I kindly ask you to take a moment to review my past emails. At no point did I confirm that I agreed to the works or gave consent to proceed. In fact, I’ve repeatedly asked Sylvia for proper information and clarification, which I never received. The only thing I said was that I might be out of touch — which I clearly explained was because I needed a break from all this due to how much stress it had caused me. And now, after several days of silence, I suddenly receive a reminder that the works are happening tomorrow?\n        I have no idea what’s going to happen to me tomorrow.\n        You’re asking me to provide access for something I was never truly consulted on. I was not given 14 days’ notice. And more importantly — where do you actually expect me to stay? I just paid $2,825 in rent. I have no money for a second place. I can’t share a bedroom with my co-tenant. And no one from your office, including Sylvia, has ever addressed that properly.\n        If this is the agency’s internal policy — to carry out major internal works while offering no accommodation or practical alternatives to the tenant — then please confirm that to me clearly. It would actually be helpful for me to have that confirmed, because I have now submitted this matter to VCAT and am preparing to provide a complete record of what’s happened.\n        Again, I am not refusing access. I am simply asking a question that no one has answered: where am I supposed to stay?\n        Also, please do not attempt to contact me by phone. I will not answer any calls.

I want to start by sincerely apologising for the inconvenience and frustration this ongoing issue has caused you. I truly understand how disruptive this must be, and I appreciate your continued patience throughout.\nAfter reviewing the communication trail, I want to clarify that the source of the leak originates from a common area of the building, which falls under the Owners Corporation's (OC) responsibility. As a result, all scheduling and repair works need to be coordinated through them. Unfortunately, this has contributed to the delays, and I understand how frustrating that can be.\nTo address your first question: Sylvia did send an email on 18 June 2025 to both you and Podjana once the OC confirmed the appointment details. I’ve attached a screenshot of that email for your reference. It’s possible it was missed, but I’m glad to hear that you’ll be able to provide access tomorrow.\nRegarding alternative accommodation, it was my understanding that the agreed $800 compensation was intended to help offset those costs. If I’ve misunderstood or missed anything, please do let me know—there’s been a lot of emails, and I want to ensure nothing important is overlooked. The amount will be set as rent credit once the repair is commenced. \nAgain, I truly empathise with your situation. From what I’ve seen, Sylvia has been doing her utmost to keep communication flowing between all parties involved—yourself, the rental provider, the OC, and their plumber. Unfortunately, her ability to act is limited when the responsible party is not as responsive as we would hope.\nPlease rest assured that we will continue to follow up closely and advocate for this to be resolved as quickly as possible.\nJohnson Tan\nSenior Relationship Manager\n \nM 0420 846 041 \nE johnson.tan@areal.com.au\nP 03 9818 8991\nA 33 Camberwell Road Hawthorn East VIC 3123\n         \nOn 23/06/2025 3:38 PM, Chawakorn Kamnuansil <ck.chawakorn@gmail.com> wrote:\n    Dear Johnson,\n    Thank you for your message. And honestly, I’m relieved to hear from someone new, because I don’t feel that Sylvia Hao ever fully understood what I’ve been trying to say from the start.\n    Happy holiday to Sylvia — I hope she’s having a relaxing break. I wish I could take one too under the current circumstances.\n    I kindly ask you to take a moment to review my past emails. At no point did I confirm that I agreed to the works or gave consent to proceed. In fact, I’ve repeatedly asked Sylvia for proper information and clarification, which I never received. The only thing I said was that I might be out of touch — which I clearly explained was because I needed a break from all this due to how much stress it had caused me. And now, after several days of silence, I suddenly receive a reminder that the works are happening tomorrow?\n    I have no idea what’s going to happen to me tomorrow.\n    You’re asking me to provide access for something I was never truly consulted on. I was not given 14 days’ notice. And more importantly — where do you actually expect me to stay? I just paid $2,825 in rent. I have no money for a second place. I can’t share a bedroom with my co-tenant. And no one from your office, including Sylvia, has ever addressed that properly.\n    If this is the agency’s internal policy — to carry out major internal works while offering no accommodation or practical alternatives to the tenant — then please confirm that to me clearly. It would actually be helpful for me to have that confirmed, because I have now submitted this matter to VCAT and am preparing to provide a complete record of what’s happened.\n    Again, I am not refusing access. I am simply asking a question that no one has answered: where am I supposed to stay?\n    Also, please do not attempt to contact me by phone. I will not answer any calls. All communication must be in writing by email, as phone calls cannot be recorded or documented for evidence purposes.\n    Regards,\n    Chawakorn Kamnuansil\n    On Mon, 23 Jun 2025 at 14:35, Johnson Tan - Areal Property Hawthorn (MPM) <MPM@email.propertyme.com> wrote:\n        agent image	\n        	\n        Hi Chawakorn,\n        Good afternoon and hope you are well.\n        Sylvia is currently on leave and will be back on 7 July. \n        Just a quick reminder that the remediation work will be commenced on tomorrow (24 June) at 8:30AM. \n        Please ensure you will be able to provide access for the trade. \n        Thank you very much! \n        Johnson Tan\n        Senior Relationship Manager\n         \n        M 0420 846 041 \n        E johnson.tan@areal.com.au\n        P 03 9818 8991\n        A 33 Camberwell Road Hawthorn East VIC 3123\n                 \n        On 16/06/2025 11:51 AM, MPM@email.propertyme.comwrote:\n            Hi Chawakorn,\n            Thanks so much for checking in and for confirming.\n            We’re currently following up with the Owners Corporation to lock in the repair schedule, and we’ll send through an update as soon as we hear back from their team.\n            If anything comes through today, I’ll definitely pass it on.\n            Thanks again for your patience and understanding — we’re getting closer.\n            Warm regards,\n            Sylvia Hao\n            Relationship Manager\n             \n            M   0420 675 561\n            P    03 9818 8991\n            A    33 Camberwell Road, Hawthorn East VIC 3123\n                    \n            On 16/06/2025 4:37 AM, Chawakorn Kamnuansil <ck.chawakorn@gmail.com> wrote:\n                just wondering if there’s any update on the general repair days or schedule?\n                if you have anything rough before 9:30 monday, feel free to send it through, just so I can sort out what to do\n                not a big deal either way, just thought I’d check\n                i’ll probably just reply before 12:00 like you mentioned\n                might be out of touch after that\n                thanks\n                chawakorn\n                On Fri, 13 Jun 2025 at 17:22, Sylvia Hao - Areal Property Hawthorn (MPM) <MPM@email.propertyme.com> wrote:\n                    agent image	\n                    	\n                    Dear Chawakorn,\n                    I hope you're well, and thank you again for your continued engagement regarding the repair matter.\n                    Following instructions from the rental provider, we are now arranging to proceed with the required repairs to the water-damaged wall and flooring.

And honestly, I’m relieved to hear from someone new, because I don’t feel that Sylvia Hao ever fully understood what I’ve been trying to say from the start.\nHappy holiday to Sylvia — I hope she’s having a relaxing break. I wish I could take one too under the current circumstances.\nI kindly ask you to take a moment to review my past emails. At no point did I confirm that I agreed to the works or gave consent to proceed. In fact, I’ve repeatedly asked Sylvia for proper information and clarification, which I never received. The only thing I said was that I might be out of touch — which I clearly explained was because I needed a break from all this due to how much stress it had caused me. And now, after several days of silence, I suddenly receive a reminder that the works are happening tomorrow?\nI have no idea what’s going to happen to me tomorrow.\nYou’re asking me to provide access for something I was never truly consulted on. I was not given 14 days’ notice. And more importantly — where do you actually expect me to stay? I just paid $2,825 in rent. I have no money for a second place. I can’t share a bedroom with my co-tenant. And no one from your office, including Sylvia, has ever addressed that properly.\nIf this is the agency’s internal policy — to carry out major internal works while offering no accommodation or practical alternatives to the tenant — then please confirm that to me clearly. It would actually be helpful for me to have that confirmed, because I have now submitted this matter to VCAT and am preparing to provide a complete record of what’s happened.\nAgain, I am not refusing access. I am simply asking a question that no one has answered: where am I supposed to stay?\nAlso, please do not attempt to contact me by phone. I will not answer any calls. All communication must be in writing by email, as phone calls cannot be recorded or documented for evidence purposes.\nRegards,\nChawakorn Kamnuansil\nOn Mon, 23 Jun 2025 at 14:35, Johnson Tan - Areal Property Hawthorn (MPM) <MPM@email.propertyme.com> wrote:\n    agent image 		\n    Hi Chawakorn,\n    Good afternoon and hope you are well.\n    Sylvia is currently on leave and will be back on 7 July. \n    Just a quick reminder that the remediation work will be commenced on tomorrow (24 June) at 8:30AM. \n    Please ensure you will be able to provide access for the trade. \n    Thank you very much! \n    Johnson Tan\n    Senior Relationship Manager\n     \n    M 0420 846 041 \n    E johnson.tan@areal.com.au\n    P 03 9818 8991\n    A 33 Camberwell Road Hawthorn East VIC 3123\n             \n    On 16/06/2025 11:51 AM, MPM@email.propertyme.com wrote:\n        Hi Chawakorn,\n        Thanks so much for checking in and for confirming.\n        We’re currently following up with the Owners Corporation to lock in the repair schedule, and we’ll send through an update as soon as we hear back from their team.\n        If anything comes through today, I’ll definitely pass it on.\n        Thanks again for your patience and understanding — we’re getting closer.\n        Warm regards,\n        Sylvia Hao\n        Relationship Manager\n         \n        M   0420 675 561\n        P    03 9818 8991\n        A    33 Camberwell Road, Hawthorn East VIC 3123\n                \n        On 16/06/2025 4:37 AM, Chawakorn Kamnuansil <ck.chawakorn@gmail.com> wrote:\n            just wondering if there’s any update on the general repair days or schedule?\n            if you have anything rough before 9:30 monday, feel free to send it through, just so I can sort out what to do\n            not a big deal either way, just thought I’d check\n            i’ll probably just reply before 12:00 like you mentioned\n            might be out of touch after that\n            thanks\n            chawakorn\n            On Fri, 13 Jun 2025 at 17:22, Sylvia Hao - Areal Property Hawthorn (MPM) <MPM@email.propertyme.com> wrote:\n                agent image	\n                	\n                Dear Chawakorn,\n                I hope you're well, and thank you again for your continued engagement regarding the repair matter.\n                Following instructions from the rental provider, we are now arranging to proceed with the required repairs to the water-damaged wall and flooring.

These works are necessary to prevent further deterioration of the property.\n        To ensure works can commence without further delay, please expect a formal Notice of Entry to be issued on Monday, 16 June 2025. This is in accordance with the Residential Tenancies Act and will confirm the entry date and time for the Owners Corporation’s contractors to attend.\n        As previously advised, the repair process is estimated to take approximately 7–12 days. If you have any preferred times or specific availability for the week ahead, please feel free to share this by 12:00 PM Monday, 16 June, and we’ll do our best to coordinate accordingly. However, please note that access must be provided to prevent further damage and comply with maintenance obligations.\n        In terms of rent compensation, a rent credit of $800 will be applied and reflected on your ledger. This offer has been confirmed by the rental provider as final, with no further compensation to be considered.\n        If you feel the current tenancy no longer suits your circumstances, the owner is open to discussing a mutual lease termination, without penalty, should you wish to explore that option.\n        Please don’t hesitate to reach out with any further questions or concerns — we remain committed to a timely and fair resolution.\n        Warm regards,\n        Sylvia Hao\n        Relationship Manager\n         \n        M   0420 675 561\n        P    03 9818 8991\n        A    33 Camberwell Road, Hawthorn East VIC 3123\n                \n        On 13/06/2025 10:11 AM, MPM@email.propertyme.comwrote:\n            On 13/06/2025 6:19 AM, Chawakorn Kamnuansil <ck.chawakorn@gmail.com> wrote:\n                    Dear Sylvia,\n                    I’ve taken some time to reflect on the communication surrounding this matter — not just in the past few days, but throughout the entire process.\n                    The meeting times proposed in your recent email were sent without any acknowledgement of my previous proposal, no explanation for the lack of response to the 9:00 AM deadline I had clearly stated, and no apology for the time and preparation that were disregarded when your office failed to respond. That silence, in itself, said a great deal.\n                    In addition, the questions I have raised — including the breakdown of the $800 figure, the repair timeline, and the specific conditions affecting my tenancy — have still not been addressed in writing.

These are matters that should be readily available to your team, and I find it concerning that they remain unanswered despite repeated and reasonable requests.\n            I’ve done my best to remain cooperative, flexible, and patient, even though I am the one living with the ongoing impact. But based on the way this has been handled, I no longer believe that an in-person meeting will lead to any meaningful resolution — especially when my time and concerns have not been respected.\n            Accordingly, I will not be attending any further meetings. From this point forward, I will only continue this matter through formal written communication. If that clarity is not provided, I will proceed with the appropriate next steps without further notice.\n            I have made every effort to avoid escalation. If communication continues in this pattern, the matter will simply follow its natural course.\n            Sincerely,\n            Chawakorn Kamnuansil\n>         On 12 Jun 2025, at 15:46, Sylvia Hao - Areal Property Hawthorn (MPM) <MPM@email.propertyme.com> wrote:\n>\n>         Email\n>         agent image 		\n>         Dear Chawakorn,\n>\n>         Thank you for your thoughtful response and for your continued openness to resolving this matter collaboratively.\n>\n>         We understand the importance of your questions regarding the proposed rent adjustment, repair timeline, and related concerns.

Such unclear and last-minute communication cannot form the basis for valid consent.\n>\n>                             Secondly, I must emphasise that I cannot authorise access until the following points are clearly confirmed in writing:\n>\n>                             1. A definitive and specific repair timeline, including projected completion date.\n>                             2. Whether temporary relocation will be required, and if so, what arrangements or compensation are being offered.\n>                             3. Your position on my formal request for rent reduction and confirmation of non-liability, which remain outstanding.\n>                             4. Acknowledgment of the impact on my co-tenant, who is also named in the lease agreement, and who will equally be affected by noise and accessibility issues related to the drying equipment.\n>\n>                             It is my responsibility to ensure that any agreement made does not inadvertently waive our legal rights or create further hardship.

That silence, in itself, said a great deal.\n    In addition, the questions I have raised — including the breakdown of the $800 figure, the repair timeline, and the specific conditions affecting my tenancy — have still not been addressed in writing. These are matters that should be readily available to your team, and I find it concerning that they remain unanswered despite repeated and reasonable requests.\n    I’ve done my best to remain cooperative, flexible, and patient, even though I am the one living with the ongoing impact. But based on the way this has been handled, I no longer believe that an in-person meeting will lead to any meaningful resolution — especially when my time and concerns have not been respected.\n    Accordingly, I will not be attending any further meetings. From this point forward, I will only continue this matter through formal written communication. If that clarity is not provided, I will proceed with the appropriate next steps without further notice.\n    I have made every effort to avoid escalation. If communication continues in this pattern, the matter will simply follow its natural course.\n    Sincerely,\n    Chawakorn Kamnuansil\n> On 12 Jun 2025, at 15:46, Sylvia Hao - Areal Property Hawthorn (MPM) <MPM@email.propertyme.com> wrote:\n>\n> Email\n> agent image 		\n> Dear Chawakorn,\n>\n> Thank you for your thoughtful response and for your continued openness to resolving this matter collaboratively.\n>\n> We understand the importance of your questions regarding the proposed rent adjustment, repair timeline, and related concerns.

Such unclear and last-minute communication cannot form the basis for valid consent.\n>\n>                     Secondly, I must emphasise that I cannot authorise access until the following points are clearly confirmed in writing:\n>\n>                     1. A definitive and specific repair timeline, including projected completion date.\n>                     2. Whether temporary relocation will be required, and if so, what arrangements or compensation are being offered.\n>                     3. Your position on my formal request for rent reduction and confirmation of non-liability, which remain outstanding.\n>                     4. Acknowledgment of the impact on my co-tenant, who is also named in the lease agreement, and who will equally be affected by noise and accessibility issues related to the drying equipment.\n>\n>                     It is my responsibility to ensure that any agreement made does not inadvertently waive our legal rights or create further hardship.

However, I am currently unable to provide consent for any repair work to begin.\n                    Firstly, your email referred to repairs commencing on """"Thursday, 6 June""""a date which had already passed at the time of your message. This inconsistency is not just confusing; it is logistically impossible and calls into question the seriousness of the repair planning. Such unclear and last-minute communication cannot form the basis for valid consent.\n                    Secondly, I must emphasise that I cannot authorise access until the following points are clearly confirmed in writing:\n                    1. A definitive and specific repair timeline, including projected completion date.\n                    2. Whether temporary relocation will be required, and if so, what arrangements or compensation are being offered.\n                    3. Your position on my formal request for rent reduction and confirmation of non-liability, which remain outstanding.\n                    4. Acknowledgment of the impact on my co-tenant, who is also named in the lease agreement, and who will equally be affected by noise and accessibility issues related to the drying equipment.\n                    It is my responsibility to ensure that any agreement made does not inadvertently waive our legal rights or create further hardship. I must act cautiously, especially as the installation of industrial drying equipment operating 24/7 poses real disturbancessomething your office acknowledged in our previous phone call.\n                    If I were to consent now without these matters resolved in writing, it could later be used to suggest that I accepted all resulting conditions, which I absolutely do not.\n                    Therefore, I will only provide access once I receive formal written confirmation addressing all points above. Until then, I consider it unreasonable to demand a commitment from me, especially under these unclear and one-sided circumstances.\n                    As noted in my formal demand, if a resolution is not reached within five (5) calendar daysincluding weekendsI will proceed to file an application with VCAT.\n                    Kind regards,\n                    Chawakorn Kamnuansil\n                    ck.chawakorn@gmail.com\n                    On Fri, 6 Jun 2025 at 11:50, Sylvia Hao - Areal Property Hawthorn (MPM) <MPM@email.propertyme.com> wrote:\n                        agent image	\n                        	\n                        Dear Chawakorn,\n                        Thank you for your email and the supporting documents outlining your concerns and formal request.\n                        We understand the impact this situation has had on your tenancy and appreciate the way you’ve approached the matter.

So I hope that context can be considered as part of your team’s preparation before we meet. It would really help if everything could be brought or explained clearly during the discussion, so we don’t go in circles.\nTo keep things moving forward, I’d like to propose an in-person meeting at your office on Thursday, 12 June at 10:30 AM. I’ll be bringing a support person with me as well. Nothing formal — just someone to help me navigate things clearly.\nIf this time doesn’t work for your team, please let me know by 9:00 AM Thursday. If I don’t hear back by then, I’ll assume the meeting can’t go ahead as suggested and will take the next steps from there.\nThank you again — I’m still hopeful we can bring this to a clear and fair resolution.\nKind regards,\nChawakorn Kamnuansil\nOn Tue, 10 Jun 2025 at 16:19, Sylvia Hao - Areal Property Hawthorn (MPM) <MPM@email.propertyme.com> wrote:\n    agent image 		\n    Dear Chawakorn,\n    I’ve received confirmation from the Owners Corporation that they are happy to proceed with the previously proposed rent reduction of $800.00.\n    Could you kindly confirm if you’re happy with this adjustment?\n    Once confirmed, we’ll proceed accordingly.\n    Kind regards,\n    Sylvia Hao\n    Relationship Manager\n     \n    M   0420 675 561\n    P    03 9818 8991\n    A    33 Camberwell Road, Hawthorn East VIC 3123\n            \n    On 10/06/2025 12:55 PM, """"Sylvia Hao - Areal Property Hawthorn (MPM)"""" <MPM@email.propertyme.com> wrote:\n        Email\n        agent image 		\n        Dear Chawakorn,\n        Thank you for your email and for clearly outlining your concerns.

We’ve approached them regarding possible rent compensation for the temporary loss of use of the affected bedroom.\nWhile this type of situation doesn’t meet the insurance excess threshold for a formal claim, the Owners Corporation has advised they may consider a rent reduction of approximately 10% to 30% during the works, depending on the impact and supporting documentation.\nTo proceed, they require a formal written request from you, outlining:\nYour request for rent compensation;\nThe amount requested (e.g., 30%);\nA brief explanation (e.g., inability to use the bedroom due to drying equipment or repairs).\nI'm more than happy to support a request for the higher end of the range (30%) on your behalf. Please let me know if you’re comfortable with this, and feel free to send me your formal request so we can submit it to the Owners Corporation for review.\nIf you have any questions or need help wording your request, I’m here to assist.\nLooking forward to hearing from you.\nWarm regards,\nSylvia Hao\nRelationship Manager\n \nM   0420 675 561\nP    03 9818 8991\nA    33 Camberwell Road, Hawthorn East VIC 3123\n        \nOn 3/06/2025 3:12 PM, Chawakorn Kamnuansil <ck.chawakorn@gmail.com> wrote:\n    Dear Sylvia,\n    Thank you for your email.\n    I confirm that access to the bedroom can be provided as required to facilitate the scheduled repairs.

I submitted multiple written reports, yet no action was taken to mitigate the impact for several weeks. This has resulted in substantial disruption and compromised my ability to safely and reasonably occupy the premises.\n    Given this, I request that your office assess and propose an appropriate rent reduction or compensation, in line with the responsibilities of the rental provider under the Residential Tenancies Act 1997 (VIC). The current circumstances reflect a clear breach of my right to quiet enjoyment, as well as your obligation to attend to urgent repairs in a timely manner.\n    I also wish to express concern regarding the proposed solution that I relocate for the duration of repairs without any logistical or financial support.

Thank you for your recent correspondence and for processing my payment receipt — much appreciated.\n \nI’m writing to follow up on a non-urgent maintenance request I originally submitted on 2 April regarding the deteriorating bed frame in my apartment (Unit 1803, 243 Franklin Street, Melbourne VIC 3000). As I haven’t received a response to that email yet, I wanted to make sure it was received and kindly ask for your guidance on the next steps.\n \nTo help move things forward without adding to your team’s workload, I’d like to propose an alternative solution — if it’s possible under your policy, I’d be happy to purchase and install a new bed frame myself, and then submit the official receipt for reimbursement under the maintenance allowance.\n \nThis would:\n• Save time coordinating with contractors,\n• Allow me to select a frame that suits my needs,\n• And reduce the administrative load on your side.\n \nOf course, I would only proceed if it’s approved in advance and would comply with any requirements you may have in terms of budget, documentation, or supplier type.\n \nIf this approach is acceptable, could you please kindly advise:\n1. What the maximum reimbursable budget would be?\n2. How long it typically takes for reimbursement after submitting receipts?\n \nI’ve forwarded the original email below for your reference, along with photos and details.\n \nThank you very much for your time and understanding.
