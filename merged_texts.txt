RE: Non-Urgent Maintenance Request (1803/243 Franklin st) Ð Broken Bed Frame with Exposed Nails

Subject: Fwd: Non-Urgent Maintenance Request (1803/243 Franklin st) Ð Broken Bed Frame with
Exposed Nails

Dear Hilary,

I hope this message Þnds you well. Thank you for your recent correspondence and for
processing my payment receipt Ñ much appreciated.

IÕm writing to follow up on a non-urgent maintenance request I originally submitted on 2 April
regarding the deteriorating bed frame in my apartment (Unit 1803, 243 Franklin Street,
Melbourne VIC 3000). As I havenÕt received a response to that email yet, I wanted to make sure
it was received and kindly ask for your guidance on the next steps.

To help move things forward without adding to your teamÕs workload, IÕd like to propose an
alternative solution Ñ if itÕs possible under your policy, IÕd be happy to purchase and install a
new bed frame myself, and then submit the o!cial receipt for reimbursement under the
maintenance allowance.

This would:
¥ Save time coordinating with contractors,
¥ Allow me to select a frame that suits my needs,
¥ And reduce the administrative load on your side.

Of course, I would only proceed if itÕs approved in advance and would comply with any
requirements you may have in terms of budget, documentation, or supplier type.

If this approach is acceptable, could you please kindly advise:
1. What the maximum reimbursable budget would be?
2. How long it typically takes for reimbursement after submitting receipts?

IÕve forwarded the original email below for your reference, along with photos and details.

Thank you very much for your time and understanding. I really appreciate your help and look
forward to hearing from you soon.

Dear Property Management Team,

I hope this message Þnds you well.

IÕm writing to report a non-urgent maintenance issue regarding the bed frame in my apartment
at Unit 1803, 243 Franklin Street, Melbourne VIC 3000. IÕve attached several photos that show
the condition of the bed clearly.

Over time, the frame has become structurally compromised due to regular usage. I can
conÞdently conÞrm that there has been no misuse on my part. Recently, the issue has worsened
Ñone side of the frame has come apart and exposed some nails. Unfortunately, I did sustain a
light scratch on my leg because of this.

The misalignment also makes it very di!cult to use the drawer underneath the bed, and the
headboard has started to detach slightly as well. Items often fall into the gap thatÕs opened up
behind the bed, and IÕm hesitant to reach in due to the protruding nails.

I understand that other tenants may be facing more urgent problems and IÕm happy to wait my
turnÑthis is not an emergency. I just wanted to make sure itÕs on record, and that it can
hopefully be addressed when itÕs suitable for your schedule.

Please feel free to reach out if you need any more details or clariÞcation. I appreciate your help
and look forward to hearing from you when possible.

Dear Hilary,

IÕm contacting you regarding an urgent issue in my unit (1803, 243 Franklin Street). This
evening , I noticed a water leak forming on the wall above my bed. Within a single day, it spread
rapidly Ñ now forming a long vertical swelling nearly from ceiling to ßoor.

I live on the top ßoor, so this may indicate a ceiling or roof issue. IÕm concerned it could worsen
quickly if not addressed.

Please arrange for a maintenance inspection as soon as possible. IÕve attached photos for
reference. Let me know if I need to do anything in the meantime.

Also, IÕd appreciate an update on the status of the bed repair I previously reported.

Thanks,

Dear Hilary and Sylvia,

I hope you are both doing well.

I am writing to kindly follow up regarding the water leakage issue in my unit (1803, 243 Franklin Street) which I Þrst reported on 16 April.

Since then, the situation has unfortunately worsened. The water damage has expanded across the ceiling and wall, and the swelling and staining have become noticeably more severe. I have attached updated photos for your reference.

I completely understand that it has been a busy period with the Easter holidays. However, given the current condition, I am concerned about the potential for further damage and health risks due to prolonged moisture.

May I kindly ask for an update regarding the next steps or any arrangements being made?
If a professional inspection could be organised soon, it would be greatly appreciated to help prevent any further complications.

Thank you very much for your time and support. I truly appreciate your help in resolving this matter.

Kind regards,
Chawakorn Kamnuansil

Second Follow-up: Urgent Water Damage Escalation Ð Immediate Action Required (Unit 1803)

Subject: Second Follow-up: Urgent Water Damage Escalation Ð Immediate Action Required (Unit 1803)

Dear Sylvia,

I hope you are doing well.

IÕm writing again to follow up on the urgent water leakage issue in my unit (1803, 243 Franklin Street), which I Þrst reported prior to the Easter holiday.

At the time, I was advised that this would be treated as a priority and was also provided with a contact list for emergency tradespeople. In accordance with that advice, I reached out to Flood Response as listed. Unfortunately, they replied stating that they were closed on Easter Monday and unable to attend. IÕve attached a screenshot of their message for reference.

Since then, I have not received any updates or conÞrmation regarding the next steps, even though the holiday period has now ended. Meanwhile, the situation has continued to worsen.

Attached are the most recent photos taken today, clearly showing the ceiling stains spreading further, severe wall swelling, and visible water marks continuing to develop. More critically, as the ßooring in my room is carpeted, water has now begun to soak into the carpet, creating both dampness and a persistent musty odour.

This is no longer just a structural concern Ñ it now directly a!ects my personal living conditions and health. The continued moisture increases the risk of mould developing beneath the carpet, which could pose serious health risks and result in more extensive damage if not addressed immediately.

IÕve followed every step requested and have been as patient as possible. However, at this stage, I must insist on urgent action. I trust that I will not be held responsible for any resulting damages, especially given that I have reported the issue early and complied with all procedures.

Please conÞrm when a professional will attend the property to inspect and begin repairs. IÕd truly appreciate your prompt attention and resolution to this matter.

Also, if possible, could you please update my contact details to ensure youÕre using my current number: 0449 962 645.
For the previous issue regarding the bed, I suspect there may have been an attempt to reach me on an outdated number.

Kind regards,
Chawakorn Kamnuansil

Hi Chawakorn,
Thank you for your follow-up, and IÕm sorry for the continued inconvenience youÕve been
experiencing.
Under the ownerÕs instructions, weÕve managed to arrange for the Owners Corporation to
inspect the roof next week, after multiple attempts. WeÕll be sure to keep you updated as

Subject: Second Follow-up: Urgent Water Damage Escalation Ð Immediate Action Required
(Unit 1803)

Dear Sylvia,

I hope you are doing well.

IÕm writing again to follow up on the urgent water leakage issue in my unit (1803, 243
Franklin Street), which I first reported prior to the Easter holiday.

At the time, I was advised that this would be treated as a priority and was also provided
with a contact list for emergency tradespeople. In accordance with that advice, I
reached out to Flood Response as listed. Unfortunately, they replied stating that they
were closed on Easter Monday and unable to attend. IÕve attached a screenshot of their
message for reference.

Re: FW: Second Follow-up: Urgent Water Damage Escalation Ð Immediate Action Required (Unit 1803)

Since then, I have not received any updates or confirmation regarding the next steps,
even though the holiday period has now ended. Meanwhile, the situation has continued
to worsen.

Attached are the most recent photos taken today, clearly showing the ceiling stains
spreading further, severe wall swelling, and visible water marks continuing to develop.
More critically, as the flooring in my room is carpeted, water has now begun to soak into
the carpet, creating both dampness and a persistent musty odour.

This is no longer just a structural concern Ñ it now directly affects my personal living
conditions and health. The continued moisture increases the risk of mould developing
beneath the carpet, which could pose serious health risks and result in more extensive
damage if not addressed immediately.

IÕve followed every step requested and have been as patient as possible. However, at
this stage, I must insist on urgent action. I trust that I will not be held responsible for
any resulting damages, especially given that I have reported the issue early and
complied with all procedures.

Please confirm when a professional will attend the property to inspect and begin repairs.
IÕd truly appreciate your prompt attention and resolution to this matter.

Also, if possible, could you please update my contact details to ensure youÕre using my
current number: 0449 962 645.
For the previous issue regarding the bed, I suspect there may have been an attempt to
reach me on an outdated number.

Kind regards,
Chawakorn Kamnuansil

Hi Chawakorn,
Just a quick update Ñ the OC sent plumber inspected the roof this morning and
confirmed that the main issue is a leak from the hot water system. TheyÕve
recommended getting a plumber out as soon as possible to fix it.
Once the repair is done, another inspection may be needed to ensure no damage to the
membrane around the area.
We will request OC to reinstate the walls once leaking fixed.
Thanks for your patience, and IÕll keep you posted on the progress.
Kind regards,

Hi Sylvia,

It’s been over a week since the plumber attended, and I’ve yet to see any update or progress on
the condition of my unit. | had already sent photos clearly showing wall damage — fixing the
leak alone doesn’t resolve everything.

This unit is carpeted, and the leak went on for days. It’s only logical to assume the carpet and
underlay have been affected too. Does it really make sense to think the issue ends with the hot
water pipe?

Also, why has there been complete silence? It’s not even during a public holiday period this
time, and yet I’m still left waiting with no information. Is the delay coming from the building
manager, or is the owner just not interested in maintaining their own property?

l’ve been patient long enough. Please advise what steps are being taken regarding both the wall
and the carpet, and whether an inspection will be arranged.

Regards,

Chawakorn

Hi Chawakorn,

Thank you for your email, and | do apologise for the lack of updates — | understand your
concerns and appreciate your continued patience.
The plumber who attended the unit last Wednesday was arranged by the Owner’s Corporation to

address the leak from the hot water system. We are currently waiting on their formal report to
confirm that the issue has been fully resolved.
In the meantime, could you please let me know if there has been any further water ingress or
signs of dampness since their visit? This will help ensure there are no Ongoing issues.

Once we receive confirmation that the source of the leak is no longer active, we will arrange for
quotations to repair the internal damage, including the wall and potentially affected carpet and
underlay.

| understand how frustrating this situation is and will continue to follow up with the relevant
parties to ensure the matter is addressed appropriately.

Kind Regards,
Sylvia Hao

Subject: Follow-up on Wall and Carpet Damage - 1803/243 Franklin St

Hi Sylvia,

It’s been over a week since the plumber attended, and I’ve yet to see any update or progress on
the condition of my unit. | had already sent photos clearly showing wall damage — fixing the
leak alone doesn’t resolve everything.

This unit is carpeted, and the leak went on for days. It’s only logical to assume the carpet and
underlay have been affected too. Does it really make sense to think the issue ends with the hot
water pipe?

Also, why has there been complete silence? It’s not even during a public holiday period this
time, and yet I’m still left waiting with no information. Is the delay coming from the building
manager, or is the owner just not interested in maintaining their own property?

I’ve been patient long enough. Please advise what steps are being taken regarding both the wall
and the carpet, and whether an inspection will be arranged.

Regards,

Chawakorn

Hi Sylvia,

Thanks for your reply. Here’s an update on the wall — although the water has dried, there is still

a visible stain and surface warping, as shown in the attached photo.

l’ve done my best to manage it temporarily using Gumption, but this is clearly not a long-term
solution and shouldn’t fall under the tenant’s responsibility.

The wall is still visibly damaged and the room remains unsuitable for normal use. | need to

know when someone will be sent to inspect and repair the affected area. This needs to be
addressed properly, not just acknowledged.

Also, for record-keeping purposes, all communication regarding this matter must be done via

email, as phone calls cannot be documented as evidence if needed.

| expect a response with a clear action plan and timeline.

Best regards,

Chawakorn

The plumber who attended the unit last Wednesday was arranged by the Owner’s Corporation to
address the leak from the hot water system. We are currently waiting on their formal report to
confirm that the issue has been fully resolved.

In the meantime, could you please let me know if there has been any further water ingress or
signs of dampness since their visit? This will help ensure there are no ongoing issues.

Once we receive confirmation that the source of the leak is no longer active, we will arrange for
quotations to repair the internal damage, including the wall and potentially affected carpet and
underlay.

I hope you're well.
The Owners Corporation has engaged Fixd Trade to carry out internal rectification works
and a moisture survey in relation to the leak from the common roof.
Fixd Trade will need access to your apartment to proceed. Could you please let me know
your availability so I can coordinate with them and arrange a suitable time?
Their lead time to start is quite short, so your prompt response would be greatly
appreciated.
Kind regards,

Sylvia Hao

Hi Charwakorn,

Just a quick update—OC contractor has confirmed that one of the affected rooms will

need to remain inaccessible during the drying process. Drying equipment will be placed
in that bedroom, and please note it does emit a moderate level of noise and
unfortunately cannot be switched off during operation.

If you prefer not to move out during this period, you're welcome to share the second
bedroom or use the living area as a temporary alternative. Could you please confirm if
access can be arranged for the drying equipment to be installed?

Let us know what works best for you, and we'll do our best to assist.

Best regards,

Sylvia Hao

I’ve followed up with the Owners Corporation to confirm that the leak has been

resolved, and I’ve requested that the necessary rectification works be arranged
without further delay. I’ve also asked them to provide a clear timeline for

inspection and repairs.

โ understand the inconvenience this has caused and appreciate your continued

patience. I'll keep you updated as soon as I receive a confirmed plan from their

side.

Hi Sylvia,

Thanks for your reply. Here’s an update on the wall — although the water has
dried, there is still a visible stain and surface warping, as shown in the attached

photo.

I’ve done my best to manage it temporarily using Gumption, but this is clearly
not a long-term solution and shouldn’t fall under the tenant’s responsibility.

Re: FW: Follow-up on Wall and Carpet Damage — 1803/243 Franklin St

The wall is still visibly damaged and the room remains unsuitable for normal use.
I need to know when someone will be sent to inspect and repair the affected
area. This needs to be addressed properly, not just acknowledged.

Also, for record-keeping purposes, all communication regarding this matter must
be done via email, as phone calls cannot be documented as evidence if needed.

I expect a response with a clear action plan and timeline.

Best regards,

Chawakorn

Re: FW: Follow-up on Wall and Carpet Damage — 1803/243 Franklin St

update or progress on the condition of my unit. I had already sent photos
clearly showing wall damage — fixing the leak alone doesn’t resolve everything.

This unit is carpeted, and the leak went on for days. It’s only logical to assume
the carpet and underlay have been affected too. Does it really make sense to
think the issue ends with the hot water pipe?

Also, why has there been complete silence? It’s not even during a public holiday

period this time, and yet I’m still left waiting with no information. Is the delay
coming from the building manager, or is the owner just not interested in
maintaining their own property?

I’ve been patient long enough. Please advise what steps are being taken
regarding both the wall and the carpet, and whether an inspection will be
arranged.

Chawakorn

As discussed, there is potential mould growth and further damage to the carpet and plaster in
the affected bedroom. The building strata and property owners are actively pursuing
remediation works to prevent further deterioration.
To move forward, we kindly ask for your confirmation regarding access to the bedroom so that

Dear Sylvia,

Thank you for your email.

I conÞrm that access to the bedroom can be provided as required to facilitate the scheduled repairs. I will
ensure that personal items are removed in time.

However, I must formally note that the water intrusion, plaster damage, and associated issues have been
ongoing since approximately 15 April 2025. I submitted multiple written reports, yet no action was taken
to mitigate the impact for several weeks. This has resulted in substantial disruption and compromised my
ability to safely and reasonably occupy the premises.

Given this, I request that your o ce assess and propose an appropriate rent reduction or compensation,
in line with the responsibilities of the rental provider under the Residential Tenancies Act 1997 (VIC). The
current circumstances reßect a clear breach of my right to quiet enjoyment, as well as your obligation to
attend to urgent repairs in a timely manner.

I also wish to express concern regarding the proposed solution that I relocate for the duration of repairs
without any logistical or Þnancial support. It is not reasonable to expect me to independently secure
alternative accommodation within a constrained budget. The responsibility for this situation does not rest
with me, and I cannot be expected to bear its consequences. Furthermore, while I appreciate the ownerÕs
o er to stay at their Mount Waverley residence, I must respectfully decline. My daily activities, work, and
personal needs are based in the city, and any temporary solution must reßect the realities of my lifestyle
and commitments.

I will cooperate within reason, but I ask that the proposed solution be revisited in good faith to ensure it
does not transfer the burden to me for a matter caused by delays in your agencyÕs response.

Please also note that I will not accept any further contact by telephone. All future communication must be
conducted via email only to avoid disruption to my work and to maintain a written record.

If no compensation or reasonable resolution is o ered within Þve business days, I will consider escalating
the matter by submitting a formal application to the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal (VCAT). I
remain open to resolving this amicably, but the solution must be fair, timely, and consistent with the facts
of the situation.

Kind regards,

Hi Charwakorn,
Just a quick updateÑOC contractor has confirmed that one of the affected rooms will
need to remain inaccessible during the drying process. Drying equipment will be placed
in that bedroom, and please note it does emit a moderate level of noise and
unfortunately cannot be switched off during operation.
If you prefer not to move out during this period, you're welcome to share the second

Hi Sylvia,

Thanks for your reply. HereÕs an update on the wall Ñ although the water has
dried, there is still a visible stain and surface warping, as shown in the attached
photo.

IÕve done my best to manage it temporarily using Gumption, but this is clearly
not a long-term solution and shouldnÕt fall under the tenantÕs responsibility.

The wall is still visibly damaged and the room remains unsuitable for normal use.
I need to know when someone will be sent to inspect and repair the affected
area. This needs to be addressed properly, not just acknowledged.

Also, for record-keeping purposes, all communication regarding this matter must
be done via email, as phone calls cannot be documented as evidence if needed.

I expect a response with a clear action plan and timeline.

Best regards,
Chawakorn

The plumber who attended the unit last Wednesday was arranged by the OwnerÕs

Corporation to address the leak from the hot water system. We are currently waiting
on their formal report to conÞrm that the issue has been fully resolved.

In the meantime, could you please let me know if there has been any further water
ingress or signs of dampness since their visit? This will help ensure there are no
ongoing issues.

Once we receive conÞrmation that the source of the leak is no longer active, we will
arrange for quotations to repair the internal damage, including the wall and
potentially a ected carpet and underlay.

I understand how frustrating this situation is and will continue to follow up with the
relevant parties to ensure the matter is addressed appropriately.

Hi Chawakorn,
I hope you're well.
Following our recent discussions regarding the damage in the bedroom and the upcoming remediation
works, I wanted to provide you with an update.
The cause of the leak and damage has been identified as originating from the common roof, which falls
under the responsibility of the Owners Corporation (Highrise Strata). WeÕve approached them regarding
possible rent compensation for the temporary loss of use of the affected bedroom.
While this type of situation doesnÕt meet the insurance excess threshold for a formal claim, the Owners
Corporation has advised they may consider a rent reduction of approximately 10% to 30% during the
works, depending on the impact and supporting documentation.
To proceed, they require a formal written request from you, outlining:
Your request for rent compensation;
The amount requested (e.g., 30%);
A brief explanation (e.g., inability to use the bedroom due to drying equipment or repairs).
I'm more than happy to support a request for the higher end of the range (30%) on your behalf. Please
let me know if youÕre comfortable with this, and feel free to send me your formal request so we can
submit it to the Owners Corporation for review.
If you have any questions or need help wording your request, IÕm here to assist.
Looking forward to hearing from you.
Warm regards,

Sylvia Hao

achieve a reasonable solution for all parties involved.

I would appreciate your written response at your earliest convenience.

Dear Sylvia,
Thank you for your response dated Friday, 6 June 2025 at 11:50am.
As the primary resident of the property who has lived through weeks of unresolved water
damage, I must reiterate that no one is more eager than I am to see the situation resolved
quickly and properly. However, I am currently unable to provide consent for any repair work to
begin.
Firstly, your email referred to repairs commencing on "Thursday, 6 June"a date which had
already passed at the time of your message. This inconsistency is not just confusing; it is
logistically impossible and calls into question the seriousness of the repair planning. Such
unclear and last-minute communication cannot form the basis for valid consent.
Secondly, I must emphasise that I cannot authorise access until the following points are clearly
conÞrmed in writing:
1. A deÞnitive and speciÞc repair timeline, including projected completion date.
2. Whether temporary relocation will be required, and if so, what arrangements or compensation
are being o ered.
3. Your position on my formal request for rent reduction and conÞrmation of non-liability,
which remain outstanding.
4. Acknowledgment of the impact on my co-tenant, who is also named in the lease agreement,
and who will equally be a ected by noise and accessibility issues related to the drying
equipment.
It is my responsibility to ensure that any agreement made does not inadvertently waive our legal
rights or create further hardship. I must act cautiously, especially as the installation of industrial
drying equipment operating 24/7 poses real disturbancessomething your o ce acknowledged
in our previous phone call.
If I were to consent now without these matters resolved in writing, it could later be used to
suggest that I accepted all resulting conditions, which I absolutely do not.
Therefore, I will only provide access once I receive formal written conÞrmation addressing all

Re: Follow-up Ð Formal Demand & Statement Regarding Unresolved Repairs (Unit 1803)

I am writing with the intent of resolving this matter constructively and without
escalation, if possible.

Over the past two months, I have reported the water damage issue multiple times
in good faith, cooperated with your office, and done my best to remain in the
property despite the difficulties. I am not trying to be confrontational; I simply need
a clear and reasonable outcome, supported by appropriate action and
communication.

Please find attached:

1.
A formal demand letter outlining my request for rent compensation, a firm repair
timeline, and confirmation of non-liability Ð based on my rights under the
Residential Tenancies Act 1997 (VIC).
2.
A supporting tenant statement summarising the verbal communication with your
office around 2Ð3 June 2025, including the temporary accommodation proposal and
its impractical conditions.

If a fair and written resolution is not reached within five (5) business days, I will
have no choice but to initiate proceedings through VCAT. I sincerely hope this can be
avoided and that we can achieve a reasonable solution for all parties involved.

I would appreciate your written response at your earliest convenience.

Kind regards,
Chawakorn Kamnuansil

Dear Chawakorn,
Thank you for your email and for clearly outlining your concerns. We completely
understand the frustration and inconvenience this ongoing issue has caused, and we truly
appreciate your patience.
Repair Timeline:
We have formally submitted your 30% rent reduction request to the Owners Corporation
and are awaiting their response. Once we receive their feedback, we will provide you with
a confirmed repair timeline and projected completion date.
Temporary Relocation:
As discussed, the affected bedroom will need to be vacant during the repair work,
including the installation of drying equipment.
Co-Tenant Impact:
We recognize that your co-tenant will also be affected by these repairs. Please rest
assured that we will keep both of you informed about the repair schedule and any
potential disruptions.
We fully respect your decision to withhold consent until these matters are fully addressed
in writing. We are working to resolve this as quickly as possible and will provide all the
necessary details as soon as they are available.
If you have any further questions or need additional clarification, please donÕt hesitate to
reach out.
Kind regards,

Dear Sylvia,
Thank you for your response dated Friday, 6 June 2025 at 11:50am.
As the primary resident of the property who has lived through weeks of unresolved
water damage, I must reiterate that no one is more eager than I am to see the situation
resolved quickly and properly. However, I am currently unable to provide consent for
any repair work to begin.
Firstly, your email referred to repairs commencing on "Thursday, 6 June"a date which
had already passed at the time of your message. This inconsistency is not just
confusing; it is logistically impossible and calls into question the seriousness of the
repair planning. Such unclear and last-minute communication cannot form the basis for
valid consent.
Secondly, I must emphasise that I cannot authorise access until the following points are
clearly confirmed in writing:
1. A definitive and specific repair timeline, including projected completion date.
2. Whether temporary relocation will be required, and if so, what arrangements or
compensation are being offered.
3. Your position on my formal request for rent reduction and confirmation of nonliability, which remain outstanding.
4. Acknowledgment of the impact on my co-tenant, who is also named in the lease
agreement, and who will equally be affected by noise and accessibility issues related to
the drying equipment.
It is my responsibility to ensure that any agreement made does not inadvertently waive
our legal rights or create further hardship. I must act cautiously, especially as the
installation of industrial drying equipment operating 24/7 poses real
disturbancessomething your office acknowledged in our previous phone call.
If I were to consent now without these matters resolved in writing, it could later be used

to suggest that I accepted all resulting conditions, which I absolutely do not.
Therefore, I will only provide access once I receive formal written confirmation
addressing all points above. Until then, I consider it unreasonable to demand a
commitment from me, especially under these unclear and one-sided circumstances.
As noted in my formal demand, if a resolution is not reached within five (5) calendar

Dear Sylvia,

Thank you again for your recent update, and for forwarding the proposed rent adjustment of $800.

As IÕve mentioned previously, IÕm still very open to resolving this matter directly and as fairly as
possible, given the nature and duration of the disruption.

Before I can respond to the proposed amount, IÕd really appreciate your clariÞcation on a few key
points, just so thereÕs no confusion going forward:
¥ How exactly was the $800 Þgure calculated?
¥ What time period does it cover?
¥ Does it reßect one tenant or both of us?
¥ If accepted, would that payment mean I canÕt raise other issues like earlier disruption or
temporary accommodation?
¥ And whatÕs the current expected repair timeline?

From my side, IÕve been looking at the impact from around 15 April, which is when the issue
started and when I Þrst reached out. So I hope that context can be considered as part of your
teamÕs preparation before we meet. It would really help if everything could be brought or explained
clearly during the discussion, so we donÕt go in circles.

To keep things moving forward, IÕd like to propose an in-person meeting at your o ce on
Thursday, 12 June at 10:30 AM. IÕll be bringing a support person with me as well. Nothing formal
Ñ just someone to help me navigate things clearly.

If this time doesnÕt work for your team, please let me know by 9:00 AM Thursday. If I donÕt hear
back by then, IÕll assume the meeting canÕt go ahead as suggested and will take the next steps

Dear Sylvia,

As the primary resident of the property who has lived through weeks of
unresolved water damage, I must reiterate that no one is more eager than I am
to see the situation resolved quickly and properly. However, I am currently
unable to provide consent for any repair work to begin.
Firstly, your email referred to repairs commencing on "Thursday, 6 June"a date
which had already passed at the time of your message. This inconsistency is not
just confusing; it is logistically impossible and calls into question the seriousness
of the repair planning. Such unclear and last-minute communication cannot form

30/8/68, 16:50

4 of 7

Re: Rent Adjustment Ð Request for ClariÞcation and Meeting (12 June)

the basis for valid consent.
Secondly, I must emphasise that I cannot authorise access until the following
points are clearly confirmed in writing:
1. A definitive and specific repair timeline, including projected completion date.
2. Whether temporary relocation will be required, and if so, what arrangements
or compensation are being offered.
3. Your position on my formal request for rent reduction and confirmation of nonliability, which remain outstanding.
4. Acknowledgment of the impact on my co-tenant, who is also named in the
lease agreement, and who will equally be affected by noise and accessibility
issues related to the drying equipment.
It is my responsibility to ensure that any agreement made does not inadvertently
waive our legal rights or create further hardship. I must act cautiously, especially
as the installation of industrial drying equipment operating 24/7 poses real
disturbancessomething your office acknowledged in our previous phone call.
If I were to consent now without these matters resolved in writing, it could later
be used to suggest that I accepted all resulting conditions, which I absolutely do
not.
Therefore, I will only provide access once I receive formal written confirmation
addressing all points above. Until then, I consider it unreasonable to demand a
commitment from me, especially under these unclear and one-sided
circumstances.
As noted in my formal demand, if a resolution is not reached within five (5)
calendar daysincluding weekendsI will proceed to file an application with VCAT.

without escalation, if possible.

Over the past two months, I have reported the water damage issue
multiple times in good faith, cooperated with your office, and done my
best to remain in the property despite the difficulties. I am not trying to
be confrontational; I simply need a clear and reasonable outcome,
supported by appropriate action and communication.

A supporting tenant statement summarising the verbal communication
with your office around 2Ð3 June 2025, including the temporary
accommodation proposal and its impractical conditions.

If a fair and written resolution is not reached within five (5) business

Re: Follow-up Ð Formal Demand & Statement Regarding Unresolved Repairs (Unit 1803)

Dear Sylvia,

Thank you again for your recent update, and for forwarding the proposed rent adjustment of
$800.

As IÕve mentioned previously, IÕm still very open to resolving this matter directly and as fairly as
possible, given the nature and duration of the disruption.

Before I can respond to the proposed amount, IÕd really appreciate your clarification on a few
key points, just so thereÕs no confusion going forward:

¥
How exactly was the $800 figure calculated?
¥
What time period does it cover?
¥
Does it reflect one tenant or both of us?
¥
If accepted, would that payment mean I canÕt raise other issues like earlier disruption or
temporary accommodation?
¥
And whatÕs the current expected repair timeline?

From my side, IÕve been looking at the impact from around 15 April, which is when the issue
started and when I first reached out. So I hope that context can be considered as part of your
teamÕs preparation before we meet. It would really help if everything could be brought or
explained clearly during the discussion, so we donÕt go in circles.

To keep things moving forward, IÕd like to propose an in-person meeting at your office on
Thursday, 12 June at 10:30 AM. IÕll be bringing a support person with me as well. Nothing formal
Ñ just someone to help me navigate things clearly.

If this time doesnÕt work for your team, please let me know by 9:00 AM Thursday. If I donÕt hear
back by then, IÕll assume the meeting canÕt go ahead as suggested and will take the next steps

Dear Sylvia,

I've taken some time to reflect on the communication surrounding this matter — not just in the past few days,
but throughout the entire process.
The meeting times proposed in your recent email were sent without any acknowledgement of my previous
proposal, no explanation for the lack of response to the 9:00 AM deadline | had clearly stated, and no apology
for the time and preparation that were disregarded when your office failed to respond. That silence, in itself,
said a great deal.

In addition, the questions | have raised — including the breakdown of the $800 figure, the repair timeline, and
the specific conditions affecting my tenancy — have still not been addressed in writing. These are matters
that should be readily available to your team, and | find it concerning that they remain unanswered despite
repeated and reasonable requests.

I've done my best to remain cooperative, flexible, and patient, even though | am the one living with the
ongoing impact. But based on the way this has been handled, | no longer believe that an in-person meeting will
lead to any meaningful resolution — especially when my time and concerns have not been respected.
Accordingly, | will not be attending any further meetings. From this point forward, | will only continue this
matter through formal written communication. If that clarity is not provided, | will proceed with the appropriate

next steps without further notice.
| have made every effort to avoid escalation. If communication continues in this pattern, the matter will simply
follow its natural course.

Sincerely,
Chawakorn Kamnuansil

From my side, I’ve been looking at the impact from around 15 April, which is when the issue

started and when I first reached out. So I hope that context can be considered as part of your
team’s preparation before we meet. It would really help if everything could be brought or
explained clearly during the discussion, so we don’t go in circles.

To keep things moving forward, I’d like to propose an in-person meeting at your office on
Thursday, 12 June at 10:30 AM. I'll be bringing a support person with me as well. Nothing
formal — just someone to help me navigate things clearly.

If this time doesn’t work for your team, please let me know by 9:00 AM Thursday. If I don’t hear
back by then, I'll assume the meeting can’t go ahead as suggested and will take the next steps
from there.

Thank you again — I’m still hopeful we can bring this to a clear and fair resolution.

Kind regards,

Chawakorn Kamnuansil

Dear Chawakorn,

Thank you for your email and for clearly outlining your concerns. We completely

understand the frustration and inconvenience this ongoing issue has caused, and
we truly appreciate your patience.

Repair Timeline:
We have formally submitted your 30% rent reduction request to the Owners
Corporation and are awaiting their response. Once we receive their feedback, we
will provide you with a confirmed repair timeline and projected completion date.

Temporary Relocation:

As discussed, the affected bedroom will need to be vacant during the repair work,
including the installation of drying equipment.

Co-Tenant Impact:
We recognize that your co-tenant will also be affected by these repairs. Please

rest assured that we will keep both of you informed about the repair schedule and
any potential disruptions.

We fully respect your decision to withhold consent until these matters are fully

addressed in writing. We are working to resolve this as quickly as possible and
will provide all the necessary details as soon as they are available.

If you have any further questions or need additional clarification, please don’t
hesitate to reach out.

Dear Sylvia,

Thank you for your response dated Friday, 6 June 2025 at 11:50am.

As the primary resident of the property who has lived through weeks of
unresolved water damage, I must reiterate that no one is more eager than I am

to see the situation resolved quickly and properly. However, I am currently
unable to provide consent for any repair work to begin.

Firstly, your email referred to repairs commencing on "Thursday, 6 June"a date
which had already passed at the time of your message. This inconsistency is not

just confusing; it is logistically impossible and calls into question the seriousness
of the repair planning. Such unclear and last-minute communication cannot form
the basis for valid consent.

Secondly, I must emphasise that I cannot authorise access until the following
points are clearly confirmed in writing:

1. A definitive and specific repair timeline, including projected completion date.
2. Whether temporary relocation will be required, and if so, what arrangements
or compensation are being offered.
3. Your position on my formal request for rent reduction and confirmation of nonliability, which remain outstanding.
4. Acknowledgment of the impact on my co-tenant, who is also named in the

lease agreement, and who will equally be affected by noise and accessibility
issues related to the drying equipment.

It is my responsibility to ensure that any agreement made does not inadvertently

waive our legal rights or create further hardship. I must act cautiously, especially

as the installation of industrial drying equipment operating 24/7 poses real
disturbancessomething your office acknowledged in our previous phone call.

30/8/68, 16:50

Re: Follow-up — Formal Demand & Statement Regarding Unresolved Repairs (Unit 1803)

If I were to consent now without these matters resolved in writing, it could later

be used to suggest that I accepted all resulting conditions, which I absolutely do
not.

Therefore, I will only provide access once I receive formal written confirmation

addressing all points above. Until then, I consider it unreasonable to demand a
commitment from me, especially under these unclear and one-sided
circumstances.

As noted in my formal demand, if a resolution is not reached within five (5)
calendar daysincluding weekendsI will proceed to file an application with VCAT.

Kind regards,

Dear Chawakorn,

Thank you for your email and the supporting documents outlining your
concerns and formal request.

We understand the impact this situation has had on your tenancy and
appreciate the way you've approached the matter. We will now forward
your request and documentation to the Owners Corporation for
consideration of a rent compensation claim based on the current
circumstances.

In the meantime, we are aiming to proceed with the repair works as soon

Thursday, 6 June 2025, or let us know your earliest availability to provide

We will continue to keep you updated as we receive further information

Dear Chawakorn,
I hope you're well, and thank you again for your continued engagement regarding the repair matter.
Following instructions from the rental provider, we are now arranging to proceed with the required repairs
to the water-damaged wall and flooring. These works are necessary to prevent further deterioration of the
property.
To ensure works can commence without further delay, please expect a formal Notice of Entry to be issued
on Monday, 16 June 2025. This is in accordance with the Residential Tenancies Act and will confirm the
entry date and time for the Owners CorporationÕs contractors to attend.
As previously advised, the repair process is estimated to take approximately 7Ð12 days. If you have any
preferred times or specific availability for the week ahead, please feel free to share this by 12:00 PM
Monday, 16 June, and weÕll do our best to coordinate accordingly. However, please note that access must
be provided to prevent further damage and comply with maintenance obligations.
In terms of rent compensation, a rent credit of $800 will be applied and reflected on your ledger. This offer
has been confirmed by the rental provider as final, with no further compensation to be considered.
If you feel the current tenancy no longer suits your circumstances, the owner is open to discussing a
mutual lease termination, without penalty, should you wish to explore that option.
Please donÕt hesitate to reach out with any further questions or concerns Ñ we remain committed to a
timely and fair resolution.
Warm regards,

Sylvia Hao

Re: Follow-up Ð Formal Demand & Statement Regarding Unresolved Repairs (Unit 1803)

Dear Sylvia,
IÕve taken some time to reflect on the communication surrounding this matter Ñ not just in the
past few days, but throughout the entire process.
The meeting times proposed in your recent email were sent without any acknowledgement of my
previous proposal, no explanation for the lack of response to the 9:00 AM deadline I had clearly
stated, and no apology for the time and preparation that were disregarded when your office failed
to respond. That silence, in itself, said a great deal.
In addition, the questions I have raised Ñ including the breakdown of the $800 figure, the repair
timeline, and the specific conditions affecting my tenancy Ñ have still not been addressed in
writing. These are matters that should be readily available to your team, and I find it concerning
that they remain unanswered despite repeated and reasonable requests.
IÕve done my best to remain cooperative, flexible, and patient, even though I am the one living with
the ongoing impact. But based on the way this has been handled, I no longer believe that an inperson meeting will lead to any meaningful resolution Ñ especially when my time and concerns
have not been respected.
Accordingly, I will not be attending any further meetings. From this point forward, I will only
continue this matter through formal written communication. If that clarity is not provided, I will
proceed with the appropriate next steps without further notice.
I have made every effort to avoid escalation. If communication continues in this pattern, the matter
will simply follow its natural course.

Sincerely,

Chawakorn Kamnuansil

Dear Chawakorn,
I hope you're well, and thank you again for your continued engagement regarding the repair
matter.
Following instructions from the rental provider, we are now arranging to proceed with the required
repairs to the water-damaged wall and flooring. These works are necessary to prevent further
deterioration of the property.
To ensure works can commence without further delay, please expect a formal Notice of Entry to
be issued on Monday, 16 June 2025. This is in accordance with the Residential Tenancies Act and
will confirm the entry date and time for the Owners CorporationÕs contractors to attend.
As previously advised, the repair process is estimated to take approximately 7Ð12 days. If you
have any preferred times or specific availability for the week ahead, please feel free to share this
by 12:00 PM Monday, 16 June, and weÕll do our best to coordinate accordingly. However, please
note that access must be provided to prevent further damage and comply with maintenance
obligations.
In terms of rent compensation, a rent credit of $800 will be applied and reflected on your ledger.
This offer has been confirmed by the rental provider as final, with no further compensation to be
considered.

If you feel the current tenancy no longer suits your circumstances, the owner is open to
discussing a mutual lease termination, without penalty, should you wish to explore that option.
Please donÕt hesitate to reach out with any further questions or concerns Ñ we remain committed
to a timely and fair resolution.

Dear Sylvia,
IÕve taken some time to reflect on the communication surrounding this matter Ñ not just
in the past few days, but throughout the entire process.

The meeting times proposed in your recent email were sent without any acknowledgement
of my previous proposal, no explanation for the lack of response to the 9:00 AM deadline I
had clearly stated, and no apology for the time and preparation that were disregarded
when your office failed to respond. That silence, in itself, said a great deal.
In addition, the questions I have raised Ñ including the breakdown of the $800 figure, the
repair timeline, and the specific conditions affecting my tenancy Ñ have still not been
addressed in writing. These are matters that should be readily available to your team, and
I find it concerning that they remain unanswered despite repeated and reasonable
requests.
IÕve done my best to remain cooperative, flexible, and patient, even though I am the one
living with the ongoing impact. But based on the way this has been handled, I no longer
believe that an in-person meeting will lead to any meaningful resolution Ñ especially when
my time and concerns have not been respected.
Accordingly, I will not be attending any further meetings. From this point forward, I will
only continue this matter through formal written communication. If that clarity is not

I have made every effort to avoid escalation. If communication continues in this pattern,

Dear Sylvia,

Thank you again for your recent update, and for forwarding the proposed rent
adjustment of $800.

As IÕve mentioned previously, IÕm still very open to resolving this matter directly and as
fairly as possible, given the nature and duration of the disruption.

Before I can respond to the proposed amount, IÕd really appreciate your clarification on
a few key points, just so thereÕs no confusion going forward:

¥
How exactly was the $800 figure calculated?
¥
What time period does it cover?
¥
Does it reflect one tenant or both of us?
¥
If accepted, would that payment mean I canÕt raise other issues like earlier disruption
or temporary accommodation?
¥
And whatÕs the current expected repair timeline?

From my side, IÕve been looking at the impact from around 15 April, which is when the
issue started and when I first reached out. So I hope that context can be considered as
part of your teamÕs preparation before we meet. It would really help if everything could
be brought or explained clearly during the discussion, so we donÕt go in circles.

To keep things moving forward, IÕd like to propose an in-person meeting at your office

We have formally submitted your 30% rent reduction request to the
Owners Corporation and are awaiting their response. Once we receive

Dear Chawakorn,
I hope you're well, and thank you again for your continued engagement regarding the repair
matter.
Following instructions from the rental provider, we are now arranging to proceed with the required
repairs to the water-damaged wall and flooring. These works are necessary to prevent further
deterioration of the property.
To ensure works can commence without further delay, please expect a formal Notice of Entry to
be issued on Monday, 16 June 2025. This is in accordance with the Residential Tenancies Act and
will confirm the entry date and time for the Owners CorporationÕs contractors to attend.
As previously advised, the repair process is estimated to take approximately 7Ð12 days. If you
have any preferred times or specific availability for the week ahead, please feel free to share this
by 12:00 PM Monday, 16 June, and weÕll do our best to coordinate accordingly. However, please
note that access must be provided to prevent further damage and comply with maintenance
obligations.
In terms of rent compensation, a rent credit of $800 will be applied and reflected on your ledger.
This offer has been confirmed by the rental provider as final, with no further compensation to be
considered.

If you feel the current tenancy no longer suits your circumstances, the owner is open to
discussing a mutual lease termination, without penalty, should you wish to explore that option.
Please donÕt hesitate to reach out with any further questions or concerns Ñ we remain committed
to a timely and fair resolution.

Re: Follow-up Ð Formal Demand & Statement Regarding Unresolved Repairs (Unit 1803)

Thank you again for your recent update, and for forwarding the proposed rent
adjustment of $800.

As IÕve mentioned previously, IÕm still very open to resolving this matter directly and as
fairly as possible, given the nature and duration of the disruption.

Before I can respond to the proposed amount, IÕd really appreciate your clarification on
a few key points, just so thereÕs no confusion going forward:

¥
How exactly was the $800 figure calculated?
¥
What time period does it cover?
¥
Does it reflect one tenant or both of us?
¥
If accepted, would that payment mean I canÕt raise other issues like earlier disruption
or temporary accommodation?
¥
And whatÕs the current expected repair timeline?

From my side, IÕve been looking at the impact from around 15 April, which is when the
issue started and when I first reached out. So I hope that context can be considered as
part of your teamÕs preparation before we meet. It would really help if everything could
be brought or explained clearly during the discussion, so we donÕt go in circles.

To keep things moving forward, IÕd like to propose an in-person meeting at your office
on Thursday, 12 June at 10:30 AM. IÕll be bringing a support person with me as well.
Nothing formal Ñ just someone to help me navigate things clearly.

If this time doesnÕt work for your team, please let me know by 9:00 AM Thursday. If I
donÕt hear back by then, IÕll assume the meeting canÕt go ahead as suggested and will
take the next steps from there.

Thank you again Ñ IÕm still hopeful we can bring this to a clear and fair resolution.

Dear Johnson,

Thank you for your message. And honestly, I’m relieved to hear from someone new, because | don’t

feel that Sylvia Hao ever fully understood what I’ve been trying to say from the start.

Happy holiday to Sylvia — | hope she’s having a relaxing break. | wish | could take one too under the
current circumstances.

| kindly ask you to take a moment to review my past emails. At no point did | confirm that | agreed to
the works or gave consent to proceed. In fact, I’ve repeatedly asked Sylvia for proper information and
clarification, which | never received. The only thing | said was that | might be out of touch — which |
clearly explained was because | needed a break from all this due to how much stress it had caused
me. And now, after several days of silence, | suddenly receive a reminder that the works are
happening tomorrow?

| have no idea what’s going to happen to me tomorrow.

You’re asking me to provide access for something | was never truly consulted on. | was not given 14
days’ notice. And more importantly — where do you actually expect me to stay? | just paid $2,825 in
rent. | have no money for a second place. | can’t share a bedroom with my co-tenant. And no one
from your office, including Sylvia, has ever addressed that properly.

If this is the agency’s internal policy — to carry out major internal works while offering no
accommodation or practical alternatives to the tenant — then please confirm that to me clearly. It
would actually be helpful for me to have that confirmed, because | have now submitted this matter to
VCAT and am preparing to provide a complete record of what’s happened.

Again, | am not refusing access.

|am simply asking a question that no one has answered: where am |

supposed to stay?

Also, please do not attempt to contact me by phone. | will not answer any calls. All communication

must be in writing by email, as phone calls cannot be recorded or documented for evidence purposes.

Hi Chawakorn,
Thank you for your reply. I want to start by sincerely apologising for the inconvenience and
frustration this ongoing issue has caused you. I truly understand how disruptive this must be, and I
appreciate your continued patience throughout.
After reviewing the communication trail, I want to clarify that the source of the leak originates from
a common area of the building, which falls under the Owners Corporation's (OC) responsibility. As a
result, all scheduling and repair works need to be coordinated through them. Unfortunately, this has
contributed to the delays, and I understand how frustrating that can be.
To address your first question: Sylvia did send an email on 18 June 2025 to both you and Podjana
once the OC confirmed the appointment details. IÕve attached a screenshot of that email for your
reference. ItÕs possible it was missed, but IÕm glad to hear that youÕll be able to provide access
tomorrow.
Regarding alternative accommodation, it was my understanding that the agreed $800 compensation
was intended to help offset those costs. If IÕve misunderstood or missed anything, please do let me
knowÑthereÕs been a lot of emails, and I want to ensure nothing important is overlooked. The
amount will be set as rent credit once the repair is commenced.
Again, I truly empathise with your situation. From what IÕve seen, Sylvia has been doing her utmost
to keep communication flowing between all parties involvedÑyourself, the rental provider, the OC,
and their plumber. Unfortunately, her ability to act is limited when the responsible party is not as
responsive as we would hope.
Please rest assured that we will continue to follow up closely and advocate for this to be resolved as
quickly as possible.

Dear Chawakorn,
I hope you're well, and thank you again for your continued engagement regarding
the repair matter.
Following instructions from the rental provider, we are now arranging to proceed
with the required repairs to the water-damaged wall and flooring. These works
are necessary to prevent further deterioration of the property.
To ensure works can commence without further delay, please expect a formal
Notice of Entry to be issued on Monday, 16 June 2025. This is in accordance with
the Residential Tenancies Act and will confirm the entry date and time for the
Owners CorporationÕs contractors to attend.
As previously advised, the repair process is estimated to take approximately 7Ð12
days. If you have any preferred times or specific availability for the week ahead,
please feel free to share this by 12:00 PM Monday, 16 June, and weÕll do our best
to coordinate accordingly. However, please note that access must be provided to
prevent further damage and comply with maintenance obligations.
In terms of rent compensation, a rent credit of $800 will be applied and reflected
on your ledger. This offer has been confirmed by the rental provider as final, with
no further compensation to be considered.
If you feel the current tenancy no longer suits your circumstances, the owner is
open to discussing a mutual lease termination, without penalty, should you wish
to explore that option.
Please donÕt hesitate to reach out with any further questions or concerns Ñ we
remain committed to a timely and fair resolution.
Warm regards,

Sylvia Hao

Dear Sylvia,
IÕve taken some time to reflect on the communication surrounding this
matter Ñ not just in the past few days, but throughout the entire process.

The meeting times proposed in your recent email were sent without any
acknowledgement of my previous proposal, no explanation for the lack of
response to the 9:00 AM deadline I had clearly stated, and no apology for
the time and preparation that were disregarded when your office failed to
respond. That silence, in itself, said a great deal.
In addition, the questions I have raised Ñ including the breakdown of the
$800 figure, the repair timeline, and the specific conditions affecting my
tenancy Ñ have still not been addressed in writing. These are matters that
should be readily available to your team, and I find it concerning that they
remain unanswered despite repeated and reasonable requests.
IÕve done my best to remain cooperative, flexible, and patient, even
though I am the one living with the ongoing impact. But based on the way
this has been handled, I no longer believe that an in-person meeting will
lead to any meaningful resolution Ñ especially when my time and
concerns have not been respected.

Re: Follow-up Ð Formal Demand & Statement Regarding Unresolved Repairs (Unit 1803)

Accordingly, I will not be attending any further meetings. From this point
forward, I will only continue this matter through formal written
communication. If that clarity is not provided, I will proceed with the
appropriate next steps without further notice.
I have made every effort to avoid escalation. If communication continues
in this pattern, the matter will simply follow its natural course.

Sincerely,

Hi Chawakon,
I hope you're both safe and well.
IÕve just been informed by the contractor arranged by the Owners Corporation that they were unable
to carry out the scheduled repair work this morning due to an access issue. They mentioned they
rang both the intercom and your mobile but unfortunately couldnÕt get through.
After waiting for approximately an hour, they had no choice but to leave the building. As a result,
they will need to charge the OC for the call-out and arrange a new time for the job to be completed.
Our primary concern is to ensure everything is okay on your end, especially as we havenÕt heard
from you today.
Please let us know that you're safe when you get a moment, and weÕll work with the OC to
coordinate a new appointment as soon as possible.

Happy holiday to Sylvia Ñ I hope sheÕs having a relaxing break. I wish I could take one too under

I kindly ask you to take a moment to review my past emails. At no point did I confirm that I agreed
to the works or gave consent to proceed. In fact, IÕve repeatedly asked Sylvia for proper
information and clarification, which I never received. The only thing I said was that I might be out
of touch Ñ which I clearly explained was because I needed a break from all this due to how much
stress it had caused me. And now, after several days of silence, I suddenly receive a reminder that
the works are happening tomorrow?

Re: Follow-up Ð Formal Demand & Statement Regarding Unresolved Repairs (Unit 1803)

I have no idea whatÕs going to happen to me tomorrow.

YouÕre asking me to provide access for something I was never truly consulted on. I was not given
14 daysÕ notice. And more importantly Ñ where do you actually expect me to stay? I just paid
$2,825 in rent. I have no money for a second place. I canÕt share a bedroom with my co-tenant.
And no one from your office, including Sylvia, has ever addressed that properly.

If this is the agencyÕs internal policy Ñ to carry out major internal works while offering no
accommodation or practical alternatives to the tenant Ñ then please confirm that to me clearly. It
would actually be helpful for me to have that confirmed, because I have now submitted this matter
to VCAT and am preparing to provide a complete record of whatÕs happened.

Again, I am not refusing access. I am simply asking a question that no one has answered: where
am I supposed to stay?

Also, please do not attempt to contact me by phone. I will not answer any calls. All communication
must be in writing by email, as phone calls cannot be recorded or documented for evidence
purposes.

Dear Johnson,
Thank you for your follow-up regarding events. I sincerely apologize for any inconvenience caused.
I want to clarify that I have never refused access for necessary repairs. The situation on 24 June occurred due to
inadequate advance communication about the speciÞc scheduling and requirements, which left me unprepared
for the visit.
I genuinely regret that the contractor's time was a ected, and I understand this may have caused complications
for the scheduling process.
As this matter is now being handled through the formal dispute resolution process (Case RT252398), I believe
all repair coordination should proceed through the o cial RDRV channel to ensure proper documentation and
clarity for all parties moving forward.
I remain committed to resolving this matter constructively and cooperatively, and I look forward to working with
the Resolution Coordinator to establish an appropriate process that works for everyone involved.
Thank you for your understanding, and I apologize again for yesterday's circumstances.

of touch Ñ which I clearly explained was because I needed a break from all this due to how much
stress it had caused me. And now, after several days of silence, I suddenly receive a reminder that
the works are happening tomorrow?

I have no idea whatÕs going to happen to me tomorrow.

YouÕre asking me to provide access for something I was never truly consulted on. I was not given
14 daysÕ notice. And more importantly Ñ where do you actually expect me to stay? I just paid
$2,825 in rent. I have no money for a second place. I canÕt share a bedroom with my co-tenant.
And no one from your office, including Sylvia, has ever addressed that properly.

If this is the agencyÕs internal policy Ñ to carry out major internal works while offering no
accommodation or practical alternatives to the tenant Ñ then please confirm that to me clearly. It
would actually be helpful for me to have that confirmed, because I have now submitted this matter
to VCAT and am preparing to provide a complete record of whatÕs happened.

Again, I am not refusing access. I am simply asking a question that no one has answered: where
am I supposed to stay?

Also, please do not attempt to contact me by phone. I will not answer any calls. All communication
must be in writing by email, as phone calls cannot be recorded or documented for evidence
purposes.

Dear Chawakorn,
I hope you're well, and thank you again for your continued engagement regarding
the repair matter.
Following instructions from the rental provider, we are now arranging to proceed
with the required repairs to the water-damaged wall and flooring. These works
are necessary to prevent further deterioration of the property.
To ensure works can commence without further delay, please expect a formal
Notice of Entry to be issued on Monday, 16 June 2025. This is in accordance with
the Residential Tenancies Act and will confirm the entry date and time for the
Owners CorporationÕs contractors to attend.
As previously advised, the repair process is estimated to take approximately 7Ð12
days. If you have any preferred times or specific availability for the week ahead,
please feel free to share this by 12:00 PM Monday, 16 June, and weÕll do our best
to coordinate accordingly. However, please note that access must be provided to
prevent further damage and comply with maintenance obligations.
In terms of rent compensation, a rent credit of $800 will be applied and reflected
on your ledger. This offer has been confirmed by the rental provider as final, with
no further compensation to be considered.

Re: Follow-up Ð Formal Demand & Statement Regarding Unresolved Repairs (Unit 1803)

If you feel the current tenancy no longer suits your circumstances, the owner is
open to discussing a mutual lease termination, without penalty, should you wish
to explore that option.
Please donÕt hesitate to reach out with any further questions or concerns Ñ we
remain committed to a timely and fair resolution.
Warm regards,

Dear Sylvia,
IÕve taken some time to reflect on the communication surrounding this
matter Ñ not just in the past few days, but throughout the entire process.

The meeting times proposed in your recent email were sent without any
acknowledgement of my previous proposal, no explanation for the lack of
response to the 9:00 AM deadline I had clearly stated, and no apology for
the time and preparation that were disregarded when your office failed to
respond. That silence, in itself, said a great deal.
In addition, the questions I have raised Ñ including the breakdown of the
$800 figure, the repair timeline, and the specific conditions affecting my
tenancy Ñ have still not been addressed in writing. These are matters that
should be readily available to your team, and I find it concerning that they
remain unanswered despite repeated and reasonable requests.
IÕve done my best to remain cooperative, flexible, and patient, even
though I am the one living with the ongoing impact. But based on the way
this has been handled, I no longer believe that an in-person meeting will
lead to any meaningful resolution Ñ especially when my time and
concerns have not been respected.
Accordingly, I will not be attending any further meetings. From this point
forward, I will only continue this matter through formal written
communication. If that clarity is not provided, I will proceed with the

30/8/68, 16:49

Re: Follow-up Ð Formal Demand & Statement Regarding Unresolved Repairs (Unit 1803)

appropriate next steps without further notice.
I have made every effort to avoid escalation. If communication continues
in this pattern, the matter will simply follow its natural course.

Dear Chawakorn,
Thank you for your thoughtful response and for your continued openness
to resolving this matter collaboratively.
We understand the importance of your questions regarding the proposed

reach a clear understanding together.
We would like to invite you to our office at 33 Camberwell Road,
Hawthorn East, and offer the following options for a meeting on Friday,
13 June:
Any time between 11:30 AM and 12:30 PM, or
Any time between 2:00 PM and 3:00 PM (please let us know your

You are welcome to bring your support person, and weÕll ensure all

Please confirm your availability at your earliest convenience, and weÕll

Dear Matthew,
Thank you for your email regarding Case RT252398 at 33 Camberwell Rd, Hawthorn East.
I just want to share some information from my side to help you understand the situation more
clearly. I'm an international student living in this unit, and IÕm not very familiar with all the
repair or legal processes in Melbourne, but IÕm really trying to follow everything the right way.
Recently I heard that a contractor came, but I didnÕt receive any clear message or schedule
about what was going to happen. I didnÕt know if they were coming just to check or to actually
repair the problem. I also wasnÕt told if I needed to leave the room or prepare anything. Because
I live in the area that needs repair, this kind of information is really important for me to get
ready properly.
To try my best, I stayed up the whole night before working on documents and preparing
everything I thought might be useful for this case. I Þnished around 5 AM. I was trying to be
responsible and respectful of the process. Unfortunately, I was so tired that I accidentally fell
asleep in the morning and didnÕt hear anything when the contractor came. It wasnÕt on purpose,
and I really didnÕt mean to miss them.
I never refused access. I just didnÕt get clear communication about the visit and couldnÕt
prepare for it properly. I still really want the repair to be done and IÕm happy to reschedule, as
long as I know in advance what will happen and what I need to do.
Please continue with the case. The problem hasnÕt been Þxed yet and IÕm hoping we can move
forward.

Hi Matthew,
Thank you for your email.
I have spoken with them yesterday morning and they have advised that due to their tight
schedule, they will have to look into their booking and let us know when is the next available date.
The contractor advised that the next available date should be within the next 6-7 business days.
Since I havenÕt received any conÞrmation, I have just sent another email to the OC and the
contractor, asking them to provide a date & time.
I will let you know once I have heard back from them.
Thank you.

Hi Matthew,
Thank you for your email.
I have spoken with them yesterday morning and they have advised that due to their tight schedule, they will have to look into their booking and let us know when is the next available date.
The contractor advised that the next available date should be within the next 6-7 business days.
Since I havenÕt received any conÞrmation, I have just sent another email to the OC and the contractor, asking them to provide a date & time.
I will let you know once I have heard back from them.
Thank you.

Good afternoon Johnson
Can you please conÞrm whether you are able to conÞrm a time that trades will be able to reattend the property. Could you please conÞrm this by close of business today.
If not I will need to progress this matter to a hearing due to timeframes required to list urgent repair applications.
If an agreement can be reached regarding a timeframe to resolve the repair issue this matter can be struck out with a right of reinstatement. I have included the renters in this email for
reference.

Dear Matthew,
I just received your email about closing my case and I'm quite confused. I thought getting a
repair date was just the beginning of solving my problems, not the end.
**The key issues I still need help with are:**
- Compensation for 70+ days of paying full rent for an unusable bedroom
- Where to stay during repairs (the agency hasn't provided any solution for this yet)
- This has now a ected my studies - my college contacted me this week about urgent matters
**I don't understand - does getting a repair date mean I can't ask about these other problems
anymore?**
Thank you so much for arranging the July 7th repair after you contacted them. It's amazing they
could suddenly arrange it after saying they needed 6-7 business days when I was asking, and
I'd already waited over two months.
I also wanted to mention that I haven't been able to conÞrm access for the repairs yet because
the agency hasn't answered any of my previous questions about what exactly will happen during
the repairs or what solutions they'll provide. From what I understand, my ßatmate and I will
need to leave our rooms during the work, which is quite a big decision that a ects both our
daily lives directly. I don't think it makes sense for me to conÞrm anything when I haven't
received any information about the details or arrangements.
I'm very sorry if I'm completely misunderstanding how this process works. As an international
student who has never dealt with anything like this before, I realize I probably don't understand
what VCAT can and cannot help with. I was hoping you might be able to guide me about what's
reasonable to expect, but I understand if I'm asking for things that aren't part of your role.
Should I just accept whatever happens with the repairs and forget about the past 70+ days and
other problems? I don't want to cause trouble, but it doesn't feel right to just forget everything
that happened.
I'm quite overwhelmed and honestly don't know what to do about the compensation and
accommodation issues. Could you please help me understand if there are options to address
these concerns even if the repairs get scheduled?
I hope it's okay to communicate in writing as phone conversations are di cult for me with
serious matters. I don't have friends or family here who understand these problems, so I'm
trying to Þgure everything out alone.
Thank you for your patience with me.
Thank you,

Hi Matthew,
Thank you for your call earlier.
I have conÞrmed with the contractor from FIXD Trade Group, the work is now scheduled for 7 July
2025.
This is the exact same job scope, which was scheduled for 24 June 2025, but no access was
granted that day.
The work consists of few stages, and the trade will not be able to send me the timeline until he is
back to the o ce tomorrow.
On 7 July 2025, the work will be mould remediation, which is to bring the moisture level in the
a ected bedroom down.
Once the moisture level is at the appropriate level, the damage rectiÞcation job will be
commenced (wall repair & etc).
FIXD Trade Group will need multiple entries for the entire repair work.
Once I have received the timeline from them, I will forward it across so that we are all on the same
page.
If you need any further details, please feel free to reach out, thanks!

directly. I don't think it makes sense for me to conÞrm anything when I haven't received any
information about the details or arrangements.
I'm very sorry if I'm completely misunderstanding how this process works. As an international
student who has never dealt with anything like this before, I realize I probably don't understand
what VCAT can and cannot help with. I was hoping you might be able to guide me about what's
reasonable to expect, but I understand if I'm asking for things that aren't part of your role.
Should I just accept whatever happens with the repairs and forget about the past 70+ days and
other problems? I don't want to cause trouble, but it doesn't feel right to just forget everything
that happened.
I'm quite overwhelmed and honestly don't know what to do about the compensation and
accommodation issues. Could you please help me understand if there are options to address
these concerns even if the repairs get scheduled?
I hope it's okay to communicate in writing as phone conversations are di cult for me with serious
matters. I don't have friends or family here who understand these problems, so I'm trying to Þgure

Hi Matthew & Chawakorn,
Good morning and hope you are well.
I have received the reply from FIXD Trade Group Ð contractor appointed by the OC for the repair.
I have asked for the project timeline, and below is the reply:

Please see below extract from our scope of works sent to Highrise Strata.
The drying process is essential for ensuring all a ected building materials return to pre-loss
moisture levels. However, the length of drying time may vary depending on external factors such
as weather conditions and moisture content. FIXD is not responsible for delays in drying due to
uncontrollable factors. Monitoring will be conducted daily, and any necessary adjustments/cost
variations will be communicated promptly. FIXD will not be held responsible for any pre-existing
conditions discovered during the course of remediation, including but not limited to structural
defects, non-compliant installations, or prior water damage. Any discoveries will be
communicated to the insured, and additional works may be required outside the scope of this
project.
We cannot provide a timeline as per your request due to the existing site constraints and nature of
the damages.
Please note, once drying equipment is on-site, it is charged per day. If access is not provided as
required by our team, extra charges may be applicable to the renters for not providing access.
Hi Chawakorn,
Since no access was given on 24 June 2025, the contractor has sent us the attached invoice.
Please advise whether you would like to pay them directly.
Otherwise, the OC will settle with FIXD and on-charge the amount to Lot 1803A, and the rental
provider will be seeking reimbursement from you.
Please advise, thank you.

Hi Matthew,
Thank you for your call earlier.
I have conÞrmed with the contractor from FIXD Trade Group, the work is now scheduled for 7 July
2025.
This is the exact same job scope, which was scheduled for 24 June 2025, but no access was
granted that day.
The work consists of few stages, and the trade will not be able to send me the timeline until he is
back to the o ce tomorrow.
On 7 July 2025, the work will be mould remediation, which is to bring the moisture level in the
a ected bedroom down.
Once the moisture level is at the appropriate level, the damage rectiÞcation job will be
commenced (wall repair & etc).
FIXD Trade Group will need multiple entries for the entire repair work.
Once I have received the timeline from them, I will forward it across so that we are all on the same
page.
If you need any further details, please feel free to reach out, thanks!

RE: RDRV - Case RT252398 - 33 Camberwell Rd, Hawthorn East, VIC, 3123

date was just the beginning of solving my problems, not the end.
**The key issues I still need help with are:**
- Compensation for 70+ days of paying full rent for an unusable bedroom
- Where to stay during repairs (the agency hasn't provided any solution for this yet)
- This has now a ected my studies - my college contacted me this week about urgent matters
**I don't understand - does getting a repair date mean I can't ask about these other problems
anymore?**
Thank you so much for arranging the July 7th repair after you contacted them. It's amazing they
could suddenly arrange it after saying they needed 6-7 business days when I was asking, and I'd
already waited over two months.
I also wanted to mention that I haven't been able to conÞrm access for the repairs yet because the
agency hasn't answered any of my previous questions about what exactly will happen during the
repairs or what solutions they'll provide. From what I understand, my ßatmate and I will need to

Hi Chawakorn & Matthew,
Good afternoon and hope you all are well.
Quick update, we have served 3 x notice of entry today via registered post (please refer to the Þles
attached).
FIXD will need access to the property at 8AM on 7 July 2025, and for the rest of the week as
mentioned in the notice.
This will be the Þrst stage of remediation work, which is to treat the mould and bring the moisture
level down.
They might not need to be in the property for the entire 9 hours in the Þrst few days, but they will
need access to check the moisture level in daily basis.
Please be advised that if FIXD is unable to commence the work due to deny of access, the
minimum labour charge applies and the cost will be forwarded to you.
Please let us know if you have any questions about this. Thank you.

conditions discovered during the course of remediation, including but not limited to structural
defects, non-compliant installations, or prior water damage. Any discoveries will be
communicated to the insured, and additional works may be required outside the scope of this
project.
We cannot provide a timeline as per your request due to the existing site constraints and nature of
the damages.
Please note, once drying equipment is on-site, it is charged per day. If access is not provided as
required by our team, extra charges may be applicable to the renters for not providing access.
Hi Chawakorn,
Since no access was given on 24 June 2025, the contractor has sent us the attached invoice.
Please advise whether you would like to pay them directly.
Otherwise, the OC will settle with FIXD and on-charge the amount to Lot 1803A, and the rental
provider will be seeking reimbursement from you.
Please advise, thank you.

Hi Matthew,
Thank you for your call earlier.
I have conÞrmed with the contractor from FIXD Trade Group, the work is now scheduled for 7 July
2025.
This is the exact same job scope, which was scheduled for 24 June 2025, but no access was
granted that day.

RE: RDRV - Case RT252398 - 33 Camberwell Rd, Hawthorn East, VIC, 3123

The work consists of few stages, and the trade will not be able to send me the timeline until he is
back to the o ce tomorrow.
On 7 July 2025, the work will be mould remediation, which is to bring the moisture level in the
a ected bedroom down.
Once the moisture level is at the appropriate level, the damage rectiÞcation job will be
commenced (wall repair & etc).
FIXD Trade Group will need multiple entries for the entire repair work.
Once I have received the timeline from them, I will forward it across so that we are all on the same
page.
If you need any further details, please feel free to reach out, thanks!

Dear Matthew,
I just received your email about closing my case and I'm quite confused. I thought getting a repair
date was just the beginning of solving my problems, not the end.
**The key issues I still need help with are:**
- Compensation for 70+ days of paying full rent for an unusable bedroom
- Where to stay during repairs (the agency hasn't provided any solution for this yet)
- This has now a ected my studies - my college contacted me this week about urgent matters
**I don't understand - does getting a repair date mean I can't ask about these other problems
anymore?**
Thank you so much for arranging the July 7th repair after you contacted them. It's amazing they
could suddenly arrange it after saying they needed 6-7 business days when I was asking, and I'd
already waited over two months.
I also wanted to mention that I haven't been able to conÞrm access for the repairs yet because the
agency hasn't answered any of my previous questions about what exactly will happen during the
repairs or what solutions they'll provide. From what I understand, my ßatmate and I will need to
leave our rooms during the work, which is quite a big decision that a ects both our daily lives
directly. I don't think it makes sense for me to conÞrm anything when I haven't received any
information about the details or arrangements.
I'm very sorry if I'm completely misunderstanding how this process works. As an international
student who has never dealt with anything like this before, I realize I probably don't understand
what VCAT can and cannot help with. I was hoping you might be able to guide me about what's
reasonable to expect, but I understand if I'm asking for things that aren't part of your role.
Should I just accept whatever happens with the repairs and forget about the past 70+ days and

30/8/68, 16:49

RE: RDRV - Case RT252398 - 33 Camberwell Rd, Hawthorn East, VIC, 3123

other problems? I don't want to cause trouble, but it doesn't feel right to just forget everything
that happened.
I'm quite overwhelmed and honestly don't know what to do about the compensation and
accommodation issues. Could you please help me understand if there are options to address
these concerns even if the repairs get scheduled?
I hope it's okay to communicate in writing as phone conversations are di cult for me with serious
matters. I don't have friends or family here who understand these problems, so I'm trying to Þgure
everything out alone.
Thank you for your patience with me.
Thank you,

Good afternoon Chawakorn
Thank you for your email. I understand your application relates to urgent repairs and
compensation.
The urgent repair component must be dealt with Þrst as it is considered more urgent. If this
matter progressed to a VCAT hearing only the urgent repairs would be considered in a Þrst
hearing.
As a resolution appears to have been reached regarding the repairs component I will proceed to
strike this matter out with a right of reinstatement.
What this means is if you wish to proceed with a compensation claim this would be dealt with at a
later date. To do this you would request to reinstate your case using the attached form if the
repairs were not completed as agreed or if you wish to pursue compensation once the repairs are
completed.
If you wish to obtain legal advice or information you may wish to reach out to Tenants Victoria
https://tenantsvic.org.au/
Please let me know if you have any questions.

Hi Chawakorn
Here is your monthly after-hours trades list update. This update ensures that you always have
the most up-to-date version.
Please save this in a place where you can quickly refer to it in case of an emergency.
Your safety and the condition of your home are our top priorities. Below are the procedures for
reporting urgent repairs and emergency maintenance:
What is an urgent repair?
An urgent repair is any issue that poses an immediate danger to you or the property. Legally,
urgent repairs include:
◦ Burst water service
◦ Blocked or broken toilet system
◦ Serious roof leak
◦ Gas leak
◦ Dangerous electrical fault
◦ Flooding or serious flood damage
◦ Serious storm or fire damage
◦ An essential service or appliance for hot water, water, cooking, heating, or laundering is not
working
◦ The gas, electricity or water supply is not working

Hi Chawakorn & Matthew,

Good afternoon and hope you all are well.
Quick update, we have served 3 x notice of entry today via registered post (please refer to the
Þles attached).
FIXD will need access to the property at 8AM on 7 July 2025, and for the rest of the week as
mentioned in the notice.

This will be the Þrst stage of remediation work, which is to treat the mould and bring the
moisture level down.
They might not need to be in the property for the entire 9 hours in the Þrst few days, but they
will need access to check the moisture level in daily basis.
Please be advised that if FIXD is unable to commence the work due to deny of access, the
minimum labour charge applies and the cost will be forwarded to you.

Please let us know if you have any questions about this. Thank you.

Hi Matthew & Chawakorn,

Good morning and hope you are well.
I have received the reply from FIXD Trade Group Ð contractor appointed by the OC for the
repair.
I have asked for the project timeline, and below is the reply:

Please see below extract from our scope of works sent to Highrise Strata.
The drying process is essential for ensuring all a ected building materials return to pre-loss
moisture levels. However, the length of drying time may vary depending on external factors
such as weather conditions and moisture content. FIXD is not responsible for delays in drying
due to uncontrollable factors. Monitoring will be conducted daily, and any necessary
adjustments/cost variations will be communicated promptly. FIXD will not be held responsible
for any pre-existing conditions discovered during the course of remediation, including but
not limited to structural defects, non-compliant installations, or prior water damage. Any
discoveries will be communicated to the insured, and additional works may be required
outside the scope of this project.
We cannot provide a timeline as per your request due to the existing site constraints and
nature of the damages.
Please note, once drying equipment is on-site, it is charged per day. If access is not provided
as required by our team, extra charges may be applicable to the renters for not providing

Re: RDRV - Case RT252398 - 33 Camberwell Rd, Hawthorn East, VIC, 3123

access.
Hi Chawakorn,
Since no access was given on 24 June 2025, the contractor has sent us the attached invoice.
Please advise whether you would like to pay them directly.
Otherwise, the OC will settle with FIXD and on-charge the amount to Lot 1803A, and the
rental provider will be seeking reimbursement from you.
Please advise, thank you.

Hi Matthew,

Thank you for your call earlier.
I have conÞrmed with the contractor from FIXD Trade Group, the work is now scheduled for 7
July 2025.
This is the exact same job scope, which was scheduled for 24 June 2025, but no access was
granted that day.

The work consists of few stages, and the trade will not be able to send me the timeline until
he is back to the o ce tomorrow.
On 7 July 2025, the work will be mould remediation, which is to bring the moisture level in
the a ected bedroom down.
Once the moisture level is at the appropriate level, the damage rectiÞcation job will be
commenced (wall repair & etc).
FIXD Trade Group will need multiple entries for the entire repair work.

Once I have received the timeline from them, I will forward it across so that we are all on the
same page.

Dear Matthew,
I just received your email about closing my case and I'm quite confused. I thought getting a
repair date was just the beginning of solving my problems, not the end.
**The key issues I still need help with are:**
- Compensation for 70+ days of paying full rent for an unusable bedroom
- Where to stay during repairs (the agency hasn't provided any solution for this yet)
- This has now a ected my studies - my college contacted me this week about urgent matters
**I don't understand - does getting a repair date mean I can't ask about these other problems
anymore?**
Thank you so much for arranging the July 7th repair after you contacted them. It's amazing
they could suddenly arrange it after saying they needed 6-7 business days when I was asking,
and I'd already waited over two months.
I also wanted to mention that I haven't been able to conÞrm access for the repairs yet because
the agency hasn't answered any of my previous questions about what exactly will happen
during the repairs or what solutions they'll provide. From what I understand, my ßatmate and
I will need to leave our rooms during the work, which is quite a big decision that a ects both
our daily lives directly. I don't think it makes sense for me to conÞrm anything when I haven't
received any information about the details or arrangements.
I'm very sorry if I'm completely misunderstanding how this process works. As an international
student who has never dealt with anything like this before, I realize I probably don't
understand what VCAT can and cannot help with. I was hoping you might be able to guide me
about what's reasonable to expect, but I understand if I'm asking for things that aren't part of
your role.
Should I just accept whatever happens with the repairs and forget about the past 70+ days
and other problems? I don't want to cause trouble, but it doesn't feel right to just forget
everything that happened.

Re: RDRV - Case RT252398 - 33 Camberwell Rd, Hawthorn East, VIC, 3123

I'm quite overwhelmed and honestly don't know what to do about the compensation and
accommodation issues. Could you please help me understand if there are options to address
these concerns even if the repairs get scheduled?
I hope it's okay to communicate in writing as phone conversations are di cult for me with
serious matters. I don't have friends or family here who understand these problems, so I'm
trying to Þgure everything out alone.
Thank you for your patience with me.

Hi Matthew,
Thank you for your email.
I have spoken with them yesterday morning and they have advised that due to their tight
schedule, they will have to look into their booking and let us know when is the next
available date.
The contractor advised that the next available date should be within the next 6-7 business
days.
Since I havenÕt received any conÞrmation, I have just sent another email to the OC and the
contractor, asking them to provide a date & time.
I will let you know once I have heard back from them.

Hi Matthew,
We would like to bring to your attention that over the past few weeks, we have made every
reasonable e ort to coordinate with the Owners Corporation (OC) and the appointed contractor,
FIXD, to facilitate essential repair works at the property. This is now our second attempt to
proceed with the repairs. To clarify, all relevant parties Ð including the OC, FIXD, our agency as the
managing agent, and the rental provider are fully committed to commencing and completing the
necessary repairs as promptly as possible.
We are more than willing to provide any further information the renter may reasonably request to
facilitate cooperation. However, we respectfully request that VCAT take into account that we are
NOT the party impeding progress.
Hi Chawakorn,
Please refer to below response in blue, as I have communicated with FIXD prior to this email.
I will get the remaining requested details from FIXD, but I canÕt guarantee that they will reply
within 24 hours.
Given that coordinating this repair requires the involvement of multiple parties and signiÞcant
resources, your cooperation is not only appreciated but essential to ensure the work can proceed
without further delay.
Thank you.

Dear Johnson,
Your three Section-86 notices, lodged by registered post on 27 June 2025, seek entry at
08:00 AM on 7, 8 and 9 JulyÑonly **12 daysÕ** lead timeÑand leave the ÒDetails attachedÓ box
unchecked. Entry therefore remains conditional.
SEND WITHIN 24 HOURS
1. Contractor legal name, licence number & 24-hour mobile Ð Pending FIXDÕs reply
2. Day-by-day work scope (rooms, tasks, time estimates) for the full 7-day schedule The Þrst
stage of the repair involves reducing the moisture levels in the a ected bedroom, as outlined in
the Notice of Entry. During this drying process, the contractor will require daily access to the room
in order to monitor and record moisture readings. At this stage, they are unable to provide
speciÞc time estimates for this phase, as the duration will depend on how quickly acceptable
moisture levels are reached. Once the area has dried su ciently, they will proceed with the
necessary repair work. Please note that because the contractor has not yet assessed the current
site conditions in full, they are unable to provide a deÞnitive timeline or scope for the repairs at
this time.
3. Risk statement Ð water / power interruptions & noise levels - Pending FIXDÕs reply
4. Public-liability / PI insurance certiÞcate - Pending FIXDÕs reply
5. ÒTax invoice.pdfÓ **and** the alleged Òtenant-conÞrmationÓ screenshot FIXD has been
engaged by the Owners Corporation, as the source of the leak originates from a common area.
The OC will cover the cost of the repairs once the work is completed. At this stage, FIXD is unable
to provide a quote, as they have not yet been able to assess the current site conditions in detail.
Could you please clarify what you mean by a Òtenant-conÞrmation screenshotÓ?
6. Daily-rate schedule for drying equipment **plus** written assurance that no
Òno-accessÓ surcharge will be levied without a Tribunal order As previously mentioned, FIXD is
the contractor appointed by the Owners Corporation (OC), and the OC will be covering the cost of
the scheduled works. Could you please clarify the relevance of the Òdaily-rate schedule for drying
equipmentÓ? There will be no additional charges incurred, provided FIXD is granted access in
accordance with the Notice of Entry and there are no delays caused by restricted access or
obstruction to the repair process.

Hi Chawakorn & Matthew,
Good afternoon and hope you all are well.
Quick update, we have served 3 x notice of entry today via registered post (please refer to the
Þles attached).
FIXD will need access to the property at 8AM on 7 July 2025, and for the rest of the week as
mentioned in the notice.
This will be the Þrst stage of remediation work, which is to treat the mould and bring the
moisture level down.
They might not need to be in the property for the entire 9 hours in the Þrst few days, but they
will need access to check the moisture level in daily basis.
Please be advised that if FIXD is unable to commence the work due to deny of access, the
minimum labour charge applies and the cost will be forwarded to you.
Please let us know if you have any questions about this. Thank you.

Hi Matthew & Chawakorn,
Good morning and hope you are well.
I have received the reply from FIXD Trade Group Ð contractor appointed by the OC for the repair.
I have asked for the project timeline, and below is the reply:

Please see below extract from our scope of works sent to Highrise Strata.
The drying process is essential for ensuring all a ected building materials return to pre-loss
moisture levels. However, the length of drying time may vary depending on external factors
such as weather conditions and moisture content. FIXD is not responsible for delays in drying
due to uncontrollable factors. Monitoring will be conducted daily, and any necessary
adjustments/cost variations will be communicated promptly. FIXD will not be held responsible
for any pre-existing conditions discovered during the course of remediation, including but not
limited to structural defects, non-compliant installations, or prior water damage. Any
discoveries will be communicated to the insured, and additional works may be required outside
the scope of this project.
We cannot provide a timeline as per your request due to the existing site constraints and nature

of the damages.
Please note, once drying equipment is on-site, it is charged per day. If access is not provided as
required by our team, extra charges may be applicable to the renters for not providing access.
Hi Chawakorn,
Since no access was given on 24 June 2025, the contractor has sent us the attached invoice.
Please advise whether you would like to pay them directly.
Otherwise, the OC will settle with FIXD and on-charge the amount to Lot 1803A, and the rental
provider will be seeking reimbursement from you.
Please advise, thank you.

Hi Matthew,
Thank you for your call earlier.
I have conÞrmed with the contractor from FIXD Trade Group, the work is now scheduled for 7
July 2025.
This is the exact same job scope, which was scheduled for 24 June 2025, but no access was
granted that day.
The work consists of few stages, and the trade will not be able to send me the timeline until he
is back to the o ce tomorrow.
On 7 July 2025, the work will be mould remediation, which is to bring the moisture level in the
a ected bedroom down.
Once the moisture level is at the appropriate level, the damage rectiÞcation job will be
commenced (wall repair & etc).
FIXD Trade Group will need multiple entries for the entire repair work.
Once I have received the timeline from them, I will forward it across so that we are all on the
same page.
If you need any further details, please feel free to reach out, thanks!

RE: RDRV - Case RT252398 - 33 Camberwell Rd, Hawthorn East, VIC, 3123

I just received your email about closing my case and I'm quite confused. I thought getting a
repair date was just the beginning of solving my problems, not the end.
**The key issues I still need help with are:**
- Compensation for 70+ days of paying full rent for an unusable bedroom
- Where to stay during repairs (the agency hasn't provided any solution for this yet)
- This has now a ected my studies - my college contacted me this week about urgent matters
**I don't understand - does getting a repair date mean I can't ask about these other problems
anymore?**
Thank you so much for arranging the July 7th repair after you contacted them. It's amazing they
could suddenly arrange it after saying they needed 6-7 business days when I was asking, and I'd
already waited over two months.
I also wanted to mention that I haven't been able to conÞrm access for the repairs yet because
the agency hasn't answered any of my previous questions about what exactly will happen during
the repairs or what solutions they'll provide. From what I understand, my ßatmate and I will
need to leave our rooms during the work, which is quite a big decision that a ects both our
daily lives directly. I don't think it makes sense for me to conÞrm anything when I haven't
received any information about the details or arrangements.
I'm very sorry if I'm completely misunderstanding how this process works. As an international
student who has never dealt with anything like this before, I realize I probably don't understand
what VCAT can and cannot help with. I was hoping you might be able to guide me about what's
reasonable to expect, but I understand if I'm asking for things that aren't part of your role.
Should I just accept whatever happens with the repairs and forget about the past 70+ days and
other problems? I don't want to cause trouble, but it doesn't feel right to just forget everything
that happened.
I'm quite overwhelmed and honestly don't know what to do about the compensation and
accommodation issues. Could you please help me understand if there are options to address
these concerns even if the repairs get scheduled?
I hope it's okay to communicate in writing as phone conversations are di cult for me with
serious matters. I don't have friends or family here who understand these problems, so I'm
trying to Þgure everything out alone.
Thank you for your patience with me.
Thank you,
Chawakorn Kamnuansil

I have spoken with them yesterday morning and they have advised that due to their tight
schedule, they will have to look into their booking and let us know when is the next available
date.
The contractor advised that the next available date should be within the next 6-7 business

Dear Johnson,
Your three Section-86 notices, lodged by registered post on 27 June 2025, seek entry at
08:00 AM on 7, 8 and 9 JulyÑonly **12 daysÕ** lead timeÑand leave the ÒDetails attachedÓ box

SEND WITHIN 24 HOURS
1. Contractor legal name, licence number & 24-hour mobile Ð Pending FIXDÕs reply
2. Day-by-day work scope (rooms, tasks, time estimates) for the full 7-day schedule The Þrst
stage of the repair involves reducing the moisture levels in the a ected bedroom, as outlined in
the Notice of Entry. During this drying process, the contractor will require daily access to the room
in order to monitor and record moisture readings. At this stage, they are unable to provide
speciÞc time estimates for this phase, as the duration will depend on how quickly acceptable
moisture levels are reached. Once the area has dried su ciently, they will proceed with the
necessary repair work. Please note that because the contractor has not yet assessed the current
site conditions in full, they are unable to provide a deÞnitive timeline or scope for the repairs at
this time.

5. ÒTax invoice.pdfÓ **and** the alleged Òtenant-conÞrmationÓ screenshot FIXD has been
engaged by the Owners Corporation, as the source of the leak originates from a common area.
The OC will cover the cost of the repairs once the work is completed. At this stage, FIXD is unable
to provide a quote, as they have not yet been able to assess the current site conditions in detail.
Could you please clarify what you mean by a Òtenant-conÞrmation screenshotÓ?
6. Daily-rate schedule for drying equipment **plus** written assurance that no

the contractor appointed by the Owners Corporation (OC), and the OC will be covering the cost of
the scheduled works. Could you please clarify the relevance of the Òdaily-rate schedule for drying
equipmentÓ? There will be no additional charges incurred, provided FIXD is granted access in
accordance with the Notice of Entry and there are no delays caused by restricted access or
obstruction to the repair process.

Hi Chawakorn & Matthew,

FIXD will need access to the property at 8AM on 7 July 2025, and for the rest of the week as
mentioned in the notice.
This will be the Þrst stage of remediation work, which is to treat the mould and bring the
moisture level down.
They might not need to be in the property for the entire 9 hours in the Þrst few days, but they
will need access to check the moisture level in daily basis.
Please be advised that if FIXD is unable to commence the work due to deny of access, the
minimum labour charge applies and the cost will be forwarded to you.
Please let us know if you have any questions about this. Thank you.

RE: RDRV - Case RT252398 - 33 Camberwell Rd, Hawthorn East, VIC, 3123

I have asked for the project timeline, and below is the reply:

Please see below extract from our scope of works sent to Highrise Strata.
The drying process is essential for ensuring all a ected building materials return to pre-loss
moisture levels. However, the length of drying time may vary depending on external factors
such as weather conditions and moisture content. FIXD is not responsible for delays in drying
due to uncontrollable factors. Monitoring will be conducted daily, and any necessary
adjustments/cost variations will be communicated promptly. FIXD will not be held responsible
for any pre-existing conditions discovered during the course of remediation, including but not
limited to structural defects, non-compliant installations, or prior water damage. Any
discoveries will be communicated to the insured, and additional works may be required outside
the scope of this project.
We cannot provide a timeline as per your request due to the existing site constraints and nature
of the damages.
Please note, once drying equipment is on-site, it is charged per day. If access is not provided as
required by our team, extra charges may be applicable to the renters for not providing access.
Hi Chawakorn,
Since no access was given on 24 June 2025, the contractor has sent us the attached invoice.
Please advise whether you would like to pay them directly.
Otherwise, the OC will settle with FIXD and on-charge the amount to Lot 1803A, and the rental
provider will be seeking reimbursement from you.
Please advise, thank you.

Hi Matthew,
Thank you for your call earlier.
I have conÞrmed with the contractor from FIXD Trade Group, the work is now scheduled for 7
July 2025.
This is the exact same job scope, which was scheduled for 24 June 2025, but no access was
granted that day.
The work consists of few stages, and the trade will not be able to send me the timeline until he
is back to the o ce tomorrow.
On 7 July 2025, the work will be mould remediation, which is to bring the moisture level in the
a ected bedroom down.
Once the moisture level is at the appropriate level, the damage rectiÞcation job will be
commenced (wall repair & etc).
FIXD Trade Group will need multiple entries for the entire repair work.
Once I have received the timeline from them, I will forward it across so that we are all on the
same page.
If you need any further details, please feel free to reach out, thanks!

Subject: Re: RDRV - Case RT252398 - 33 Camberwell Rd, Hawthorn East, VIC, 3123
Dear Matthew,
I just received your email about closing my case and I'm quite confused. I thought getting a
repair date was just the beginning of solving my problems, not the end.
**The key issues I still need help with are:**
- Compensation for 70+ days of paying full rent for an unusable bedroom
- Where to stay during repairs (the agency hasn't provided any solution for this yet)
- This has now a ected my studies - my college contacted me this week about urgent matters
**I don't understand - does getting a repair date mean I can't ask about these other problems
anymore?**
Thank you so much for arranging the July 7th repair after you contacted them. It's amazing they
could suddenly arrange it after saying they needed 6-7 business days when I was asking, and I'd
already waited over two months.
I also wanted to mention that I haven't been able to conÞrm access for the repairs yet because
the agency hasn't answered any of my previous questions about what exactly will happen during
the repairs or what solutions they'll provide. From what I understand, my ßatmate and I will
need to leave our rooms during the work, which is quite a big decision that a ects both our
daily lives directly. I don't think it makes sense for me to conÞrm anything when I haven't
received any information about the details or arrangements.
I'm very sorry if I'm completely misunderstanding how this process works. As an international
student who has never dealt with anything like this before, I realize I probably don't understand
what VCAT can and cannot help with. I was hoping you might be able to guide me about what's
reasonable to expect, but I understand if I'm asking for things that aren't part of your role.
Should I just accept whatever happens with the repairs and forget about the past 70+ days and
other problems? I don't want to cause trouble, but it doesn't feel right to just forget everything
that happened.
I'm quite overwhelmed and honestly don't know what to do about the compensation and
accommodation issues. Could you please help me understand if there are options to address
these concerns even if the repairs get scheduled?
I hope it's okay to communicate in writing as phone conversations are di cult for me with
serious matters. I don't have friends or family here who understand these problems, so I'm
trying to Þgure everything out alone.
Thank you for your patience with me.

Thank you for your email.
I have spoken with them yesterday morning and they have advised that due to their tight
schedule, they will have to look into their booking and let us know when is the next available
date.
The contractor advised that the next available date should be within the next 6-7 business
days.
Since I havenÕt received any conÞrmation, I have just sent another email to the OC and the

I will let you know once I have heard back from them.

To Johnson,
This email is a formal response to the multiple, legally defective 'Notice to Renter'
documents issued by Areal Property. It outlines your non-compliance and contains a Þnal
demand for action.
Let us Þrst establish the facts, based entirely on your own actions and documentation:
1. Your Notices Are Invalid: You deliberately marked "NO" on your own forms, formally
declaring no details were attached. This renders them defective under the RTA.
2. You Have Fabricated Evidence: You have repeatedly relied on a non-existent
"tenant-conÞrmation" to support your false narrative.
3. Abdication of Professional Duty: Your notice directs me to seek help from
Consumer A!airs Victoria. This is a formal admission of your failure to perform your
duties as an agent, attempting to outsource your responsibilities to me.
After 70+ days of this conduct, the direct result of your failures is that one simple,
fundamental question remains unanswered. The proposed work is in our only bedroom.
Sylvia's unprofessional suggestion to "stay at a friend's place" is not a solution.
Therefore, a singular, fundamental question requires your immediate attention:
Where, precisely, are my roommate and I supposed to live while our bedroom is a
work site?
To be clear, any refusal of entry based on an unworkable or unreasonable planÑsimilar to
the unhelpful suggestions you have provided in the pastÑwill not be considered a breach
on my part. The responsibility to provide a viable, respectful solution rests entirely with
you. Consider this carefully.
I require your clear, written plan for suitable temporary accommodation by 5:00 PM
tomorrow, 4 July 2025.
If you fail to provide this plan by the deadline, I will, without further notice, Þle an urgent
application with VCAT and a formal complaint with Consumer A!airs Victoria. The
complaint will detail the entire pattern of conduct outlined in this email, including your
issuance of defective legal documents, fabrication of evidence, and abdication of
professional duties.
Your own documents will form the basis of my submissions.
Chawakorn Kamnuansil

To Johnson,

This email is a formal response to the multiple, legally defective 'Notice to Renter'
documents issued by Areal Property. It outlines your non-compliance and contains a
Þnal demand for action.
Let us Þrst establish the facts, based entirely on your own actions and documentation:
1.
Your Notices Are Invalid: You deliberately marked "NO" on your own forms,
formally declaring no details were attached. This renders them defective under
the RTA.
2.
You Have Fabricated Evidence: You have repeatedly relied on a non-existent
"tenant-conÞrmation" to support your false narrative.

3.
Abdication of Professional Duty: Your notice directs me to seek help from
Consumer A airs Victoria. This is a formal admission of your failure to perform
your duties as an agent, attempting to outsource your responsibilities to me.

After 70+ days of this conduct, the direct result of your failures is that one simple,
fundamental question remains unanswered. The proposed work is in our only
bedroom. Sylvia's unprofessional suggestion to "stay at a friend's place" is not a
solution.
Therefore, a singular, fundamental question requires your immediate attention:

RE: RDRV - Case RT252398 - 33 Camberwell Rd, Hawthorn East, VIC, 3123

Where, precisely, are my roommate and I supposed to live while our bedroom is a
work site?
To be clear, any refusal of entry based on an unworkable or unreasonable planÑ
similar to the unhelpful suggestions you have provided in the pastÑwill not be
considered a breach on my part. The responsibility to provide a viable, respectful
solution rests entirely with you. Consider this carefully.
I require your clear, written plan for suitable temporary accommodation by 5:00 PM
tomorrow, 4 July 2025.
If you fail to provide this plan by the deadline, I will, without further notice, Þle an
urgent application with VCAT and a formal complaint with Consumer A airs Victoria.
The complaint will detail the entire pattern of conduct outlined in this email, including
your issuance of defective legal documents, fabrication of evidence, and abdication of
professional duties.
Your own documents will form the basis of my submissions.

Dear Johnson,
For clarity and to avoid further confusion:
Where, precisely, are we expected to sleep while industrial dryers operate in our only
bedroom?
For how many days? What speciÞc arrangements have you made to ensure we are not left
without habitable space?
LetÕs be absolutely clear: I never conÞrmed anything. There is no message in which I agreedÑ
because none exists.
It is remarkable that after over two months of delay, the only certainty you can o er is the
threat of charges if access is deniedÑyet you remain unable to answer the most basic question
about where your tenants will live.
If Sylvia chose to claim ÒconÞrmationÓ on my behalf, perhaps the cost of this entire
situation belongs with her, not me.
I look forward to seeing whether you can provide an actual plan rather than more excuses.

Hi Chawakorn,
Thank you for your email.
I would like to seek clariÞcation on one thing, which I havenÕt received a certain answer yet.
I can see that there is a $800 compensation, o ered by the OC.
Is that compensation amount meant to be compensating the inconvenience during the work?
If so, I believe that is the reason why the OC didnÕt o er an alternative accommodation for this
job.
If no, can you please forward the email of you rejecting that o er?
Thank you Chawakorn.

Let us first establish the facts, based entirely on your own actions and documentation:
1. Your Notices Are Invalid: You deliberately marked "NO" on your own forms,

formally declaring no details were attached. This renders them defective under
the RTA.
2. You Have Fabricated Evidence: You have repeatedly relied on a nonexistent "tenant-confirmation" to support your false narrative.
3. Abdication of Professional Duty: Your notice directs me to seek help from
Consumer Affairs Victoria. This is a formal admission of your failure to perform
your duties as an agent, attempting to outsource your responsibilities to me.

After 70+ days of this conduct, the direct result of your failures is that one simple,
fundamental question remains unanswered. The proposed work is in our only bedroom.
Sylvia's unprofessional suggestion to "stay at a friend's place" is not a solution.
Therefore, a singular, fundamental question requires your immediate attention:
Where, precisely, are my roommate and I supposed to live while our bedroom is a
work site?
To be clear, any refusal of entry based on an unworkable or unreasonable planÑsimilar
to the unhelpful suggestions you have provided in the pastÑwill not be considered a
breach on my part. The responsibility to provide a viable, respectful solution rests
entirely with you. Consider this carefully.
I require your clear, written plan for suitable temporary accommodation by 5:00 PM
tomorrow, 4 July 2025.
If you fail to provide this plan by the deadline, I will, without further notice, file an urgent
application with VCAT and a formal complaint with Consumer Affairs Victoria. The
complaint will detail the entire pattern of conduct outlined in this email, including your
issuance of defective legal documents, fabrication of evidence, and abdication of
professional duties.

Hi Chawakorn,
Good evening and hope you're both doing well.
IÕm following up on my previous email regarding the compensation from the OC.
Please know that IÕm here to assist and help explore the best possible options for you.
At the end of the day, our shared goal is to have the issue resolved as quickly and smoothly as
possible.
I completely understand your concerns about staying in the property during the repair work.
When FIXD inspected the property back in May, the initial estimate for the job duration was over 7
Ð 10 days.
However, due to the delays, the condition might have been deteriorated. Hence, FIXD is unable to
provide a timeframe of the work.
As I have not yet received a conÞrmed response from the OC regarding the $800 compensation
o er, I would like to outline some options for you to consider:
1. Seek temporary accommodation during the works, and submit a reimbursement claim to the
OC, who is ultimately responsible for the leak. While this is a valid option, I must note that
we cannot guarantee the outcome of their approval.
2. Early lease termination without penalty. If you feel the property will be uninhabitable during
the repairs and would prefer not to take the risk of seeking compensation from the OC, the
rental provider is willing to allow you to break the Þxed-term lease early with no penalties.
3. If you would like to further escalate this, you can have the OC joined as a party to residential
tenancy application at VCAT
Please let us know which option you would prefer, or if thereÕs anything else we can do to support
you.
Thank you again, and wishing you a pleasant evening.

Hi Chawakorn,
Thank you for your email.
I would like to seek clariÞcation on one thing, which I havenÕt received a certain answer yet.
I can see that there is a $800 compensation, o ered by the OC.
Is that compensation amount meant to be compensating the inconvenience during the work?
If so, I believe that is the reason why the OC didnÕt o er an alternative accommodation for this
job.
If no, can you please forward the email of you rejecting that o er?
Thank you Chawakorn.

LetÕs be absolutely clear: I never conÞrmed anything. There is no message in which I agreedÑ

It is remarkable that after over two months of delay, the only certainty you can o er is the

Dear Johnson, Sylvia, and Team,

I am including Sylvia here, as she was notably quick to declare the $800 compensation as
Þnal before I had any real opportunity to respond or negotiate. Please provide a clear
explanation in writing of how this Þgure was determined.
To avoid any misunderstanding by herself only (Sylvia), I must state plainly that I do not
accept or acknowledge this amount as adequate or Þnal.

Regarding your comment about resolving this matter Òas quickly and smoothly as possible,Ó I
am referring to the Þve Notices of Entry delivered within two days, followed by no one attending
any of them. Please provide written evidence from FIXD explaining why these
appointments were cancelled or ignored.
On the repeated suggestions to terminate my lease early without penalty, why is your agency
so determined to propose ending a tenancy I have maintained responsibly? If this is
e ectively an admission that you cannot fulÞll your obligations, stating that openly would be
more professional.

Re: RDRV - Case RT252398 - 33 Camberwell Rd, Hawthorn East, VIC, 3123

Regarding involving the Owners Corporation: I am aware you would prefer not to accept sole
accountability. However, I do not have any dispute with the OC. It appears the delays have
mainly resulted from your own processes.If you believe involving the OC is necessary, please
share their contact details, as I am considering contacting them directly to discuss whether we
should explore a joint complaint regarding your handling of this matter.
For the avoidance of doubt, I expect written, itemised clariÞcation of the following:
¥ How the $800 Þgure was calculated.
¥ What this amount is intended to cover.
¥ Evidence explaining the missed appointments.
¥ The reasons for repeated lease termination proposals.
I will be collecting all relevant records before deciding whether escalation is appropriate.
I trust you will address these points clearly and in writing, without further delay.
Sincerely,
Chawakorn Kamnuansil

2. You Have Fabricated Evidence: You have repeatedly relied on a nonexistent "tenant-confirmation" to support your false narrative.
3. Abdication of Professional Duty: Your notice directs me to seek help from
Consumer Affairs Victoria. This is a formal admission of your failure to perform
your duties as an agent, attempting to outsource your responsibilities to me.
After 70+ days of this conduct, the direct result of your failures is that one simple,
fundamental question remains unanswered. The proposed work is in our only
bedroom. Sylvia's unprofessional suggestion to "stay at a friend's place" is not a
solution.
Therefore, a singular, fundamental question requires your immediate attention:
Where, precisely, are my roommate and I supposed to live while our bedroom is

a work site?
To be clear, any refusal of entry based on an unworkable or unreasonable planÑ
similar to the unhelpful suggestions you have provided in the pastÑwill not be
considered a breach on my part. The responsibility to provide a viable, respectful
solution rests entirely with you. Consider this carefully.
I require your clear, written plan for suitable temporary accommodation by 5:00 PM
tomorrow, 4 July 2025.
If you fail to provide this plan by the deadline, I will, without further notice, file an
urgent application with VCAT and a formal complaint with Consumer Affairs Victoria.
The complaint will detail the entire pattern of conduct outlined in this email, including
your issuance of defective legal documents, fabrication of evidence, and abdication of
professional duties.
Your own documents will form the basis of my submissions.

Dear Chawakorn,

You have recently been issued a notice to vacate by the property owner, with a required move-out date of
14/07/2025.

To facilitate a smooth and efficient vacating process, we kindly ask you to carefully review and follow the
instructions provided below.

Final Payments:
Your rental status is currently paid to the 22/07/2025 with $0.00 on account.
A payment of $0.00 is due and payable prior to you vacating the property for the period up to the 14/07/2025.

Where to return keys: Please return keys & a copy of any cleaning receipts to our office at 33 Camberwell
Road, Hawthorn East Vic 3123 between office hours. We are open Monday to Friday between 8.30am Ð 5.30pm
during office hours. Please note, that if keys are not returned on or before the vacate date, rent will continue to
be charged at the daily rate.

Power Connection: We recommend keeping the power connected for three business days after you return
your keys. This will allow the final inspection to be completed with the power on. If the power is disconnected,
we will need to establish a new connection, which may delay the bond return.

Final Inspection: We will conduct a final inspection of the property within 3 business days of the keys being
returned. You are invited to attend the final inspection. If you would like to attend, please let me know ASAP so
I can arrange a suitable time with you.

Bond Return: To ensure a speedy return of your bond, please return the property in its original condition, less
normal wear and tear. You can expect your bond to be returned within 10 business days. For clarity on property
expectations and to expedite the bond return process, please refer to the attached ÒMove out guide & tips to
get your bond back.Ó

Utility Cancelation: Ensure that you contact all your utility providers to advise your intended vacate date. Any
bills or charges incurred after your vacate date will be your responsibility.

Cleaning: We kindly ask that you leave the property in a clean and tidy state, as outlined in the rental

30/8/68, 16:48

2 of 2

Vacating instructions - 1803/243 Franklin Street, Melbourne VIC 3000

agreement & as per the in-going condition report. To assist with the cleaning process, we have attached the
document labelled ÒVacate cleaning guideÕÕ to help you or your preferred cleaner.

Keys and Property Access: Please ensure that all keys, remotes, and other access devices provided to you
are returned to the office and signed back in by your vacate date. Any unreturned or lost items will need to be
replaced at your expense. Do not leave keys in the letterbox due to the risk of theft. Renters are responsible for
replacing locks and keys if they are stolen from the letterbox.

If you have any questions or need clarification on any of the above points, please don't hesitate to reach out.

Warm regards,
Sylvia Hao

How to send and access evidence in a residential tenancy case | VCAT
Estimated time to VCAT
We prioritise cases that the renting laws say must be heard within a certain time, and those we
consider urgent. For example, urgent repairs are heard within 2 business days, and applications
involving personal or family violence are heard within 3 business days. It takes about 7 business
days to hear cases about non-urgent repairs. Applications for possession due to danger, damage,
or disruption are scheduled for hearing as soon as possible within 4-6 weeks. Possession
applications due to unpaid rent are heard in about 6 weeks, and most other applications for
possession and renewals are heard within 8-10 weeks.
For applications considered urgent under the law, we contact you by text, phone or email
within 24-48 hours. At an urgent hearing, only the urgent issues will be dealt with. Non-urgent
issues, such as compensation, will be dealt with when there is more time at a later hearing.
Applications for re-opening (request for a review)
If you have submitted a review of an order that allows the Residential Rental Provider (Landlord) to
purchase a Warrant of Possession, VCAT will not issue the Warrant until the review hearing is
heard.
If the Warrant has been issued before the review request was made, VCAT will make an order
placing the Warrant on hold until the review hearing is heard. If the Warrant is being executed
within 48 hours, you must contact our customer service team on 1300 01 8228 (1300 01 VCAT)
and alert us to your request.
If the Warrant is executed before an order is made placing the Warrant on hold, this cannot be
reversed.
A copy of this order is sent to all parties and the Police identiÞed on the Warrant.
If you or the Police have not received a copy of this order, please contact our customer service

Dear Chawakorn Kamnuansil and Podjana Tienmon,
I hope you are both well.
As previously communicated, we issued a Notice to Vacate requiring the return of keys
by 14 July 2025. As the keys have not been returned and possession of the property has
not been granted, we have now submitted a VCAT application (Ref: R202518589/00) to
request possession of the premises, in accordance with the owner's instructions.
Please find attached the VCAT application form and a copy of the Notice to Vacate for
your reference.
Should you have any questions or wish to discuss this matter, feel free to contact me.
Kind regards,

Sylvia Hao

Dear Chawakorn Kamnuansil and Podjana Tienmon,
I hope you are both well.
Please find attached a copy of the VCAT order dated 21 July 2025 (Ref:
R2025/18214/00) regarding your recent application.
As noted in the order, the Tribunal has suggested that if both parties can agree, a
temporary relocation for approximately 14 days would allow the necessary repairs to be
carried out at the property. Following the completion of these works, you would be able
to return and resume your tenancy.
In line with this recommendation, we would like to offer you the opportunity to
temporarily vacate the property for a 14-day period so repairs can proceed without delay.
We are happy to coordinate dates and details with you to minimise disruption.
Please let us know your availability or any questions you may have.
Kind regards,

Sylvia Hao

RE: Without Prejudice — Franklin 1803: Settlement Terms (VCAT R2025/18589/00)

Subject: RE: Without Prejudice — Franklin 1803: Settlement Terms (VCAT R2025/18589/00)
From: Jamie Ong <jamie.ong@areal.com.au>
Date: 19/8/68, 15:19
To: Chawakorn Kamnuansil <ck.chawakorn@gmail.com>
Dear Chawakorn,
Thank you for your recent email. | understand this has been a frustrating and challenging
situation, and | appreciate you taking the time to outline your position.
The damage to the bedroom has resulted from a leak originating from common property.
Responsibility for repairing both the source of the leak and the resultant damage lies with the
party responsible — in this case, the Owners Corporation. They have taken steps to arrange the

necessary works and have offered $800 in compensation to reflect the inconvenience caused to
date.

Despite multiple written requests and the issuing of a formal Notice of Entry, access to the
property has not yet been provided. We understand you may have concerns, but the works are
essential, and the Owners Corporation has been actively trying to resolve the issue. We are

currently waiting on a revised date from their trades. Once confirmed, a new Notice of Entry will
be issued. On that date, both the agent and trades will attend to carry out the works. If access is
again refused, we will proceed with an application to VCAT for a compliance order.
Our preference is to cooperate with you to ensure the repairs can proceed on the earliest available
date. The sooner access is granted, the sooner this matter can be resolved.
We remain open to working with you constructively. During the VCAT hearing, the Tribunal
member noted that staying in the second bedroom or the lounge room during the repair period
would be a reasonable short-term arrangement. While we understand the second bedroom is
currently occupied by the other tenant and this may not be ideal, it remains a temporary option to

consider. If that arrangement isn’t workable, the option to end the lease early without penalty
remains available.

In regard to your proposal, we do not agree to the requested $10,000 lump sum or a 24-month
rent freeze. These terms are not proportionate, particularly given that access for repairs has not
yet been provided. Any future compensation claim would also be assessed in light of whether
reasonable steps were taken to mitigate loss. In this case, the matter could have been resolved

some time ago had access been granted.
We’ll be in touch again once the repair date is confirmed. In the meantime, we ask that you
confirm your willingness to allow access on the upcoming date, so the matter can be finalised
without further escalation.

Kind Regards,

Hi Chawakorn & Podjana,

Good afternoon and hope you are well.
FIXD has scheduled the repair work and we have sent out the notice of entry accordingly please refer to the attached.
Repair works are required in the bedroom due to water ingress from the common property.
Highrise Strata has appointed FIXD Trade Group to carry out these works.
Phase 1 repairs - Drying process - are scheduled for:
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8 and 9 September 2025 (excluding Sunday, 7 September 2025).
This timeframe can vary, taking either less or more days depending on drying times. Once it has

been confirmed that the drying has been completed, Phase 2 (rectification) will then begin. At
that stage, FIXD will be able to provide an estimate of works once they have fully assessed the
damage.
Access will be needed from 8:00am on these dates, though the exact times may vary from day
to day depending on how the works are progressing, drying times, and other factors that can’t
be predicted in advance. FIXD will keep you updated as the works move along and will
communicate with you about timings so you’re aware.
We thank you in advance for your cooperation and will have these works completed as quickly
as possible.

Hi Shaun,

I acknowledge your 22 Aug 2025 email and IÕm happy to cooperate with Phase 1 (drying) on the
scheduled dates.

To keep the works moving without disrupting day-to-day living for me and my roommate (I
work nights and rest during the day), please conÞrm the following in writing:
¥ Accommodation: arranged and paid directly by the agency for the entire repair period (no
out-of-pocket and no reimbursement later). Near-CBD, quiet for daytime rest, with a desk
and internet.
¥ Work window (choose day-by-day; conÞrm ≥24h in advance)
¥ If accommodation is provided that day: full window 08:00Ð16:00 AEST. IÕll be o -site.
¥ If no accommodation that day: two short blocks 09:00Ð12:00 and 16:00Ð18:00 AEST;
during 12:00Ð16:00 there should be no entry and no noisy/heat-generating equipment in
the unit.
¥ Simple daily brief (non-technical): which areas to clear, whether I should be on/o -site
and for roughly how long, any doÕs/donÕts, when itÕs safe to re-use the space, and a single
on-site email contact.
¥ Utilities & cleanliness: agency covers additional power/water from the works; tidy daily;
restore condition on completion.
¥ Tenancy & rent: temporary relocation is not a surrender. On any day accommodation isnÕt
provided as agreed, or the bedroom remains unusable, daily rent abatement applies for
that day.
¥ Property damage: any damage/loss arising from the works is the agency/contractorÕs
responsibility; please conÞrm the remediation plan and timeframe in writing the same day
itÕs identiÞed.
¥ No Òno-accessÓ & comms: no Òno-accessÓ or similar charges unless ordered by the
Tribunal; email-only communication for records.

Please send the accommodation details (location/dates/terms), specify the daily time mode, and
the simple brief by 30 Aug 2025, 17:00 AEST. Once conÞrmed, IÕll prepare the space and
provide access as scheduled.

VCAT made an order enabling the renter to pay rent to the Rent Special Account and the
repairs are completed.
I want to end the Rent Special Account order and for the rent in the Rent Special Account
to be paid out as follows:
……………………………………………………………………………………………………………….
Both parties have agreed to the above and evidence of consent is attached.
The parties have not agreed to the above.
DECLARATION
I have sent a copy of this form to the other party to this proceeding and attached proof that I have done
so.
Name: _________________________________________
Signature: ______________________________________
Date: _____ /_____ /______
Proof of service of this form on the other party is attached.

WHAT THE OTHER PARTY MUST DO IN RESPONSE TO THIS FORM
IMPORTANT NOTES:
As noted in VCAT’s repair orders, VCAT may make a decision in chambers (without a hearing)
pursuant to section 100 of the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal Act 1998 , if the applicant
for renewal seeks:
•

An order for rent to be paid to the Rent Special Account because repairs have not been
completed, or

•

An extension of time for the rental provider to complete repairs, or

•

Repayment of monies from the Rent Special Account by consent.

VCAT will consider making in chambers orders regarding the above types of renewal applications
no earlier than 7 days after receipt.
If you receive this form and you wish to object to either of the above orders being made in
chambers, and/or you wish to file documents for consideration by VCAT, you must immediately
write to VCAT and the other party setting out your response.
Section 100 of the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal Act 1998
•

The Tribunal may conduct all or part of a proceeding entirely on the basis of documents, without appearance of
the parties, unless a party objects.

•

The Tribunal may conduct all or part of a proceeding (other than a prescribed proceeding or prescribed class of
proceeding) entirely on the basis of documents, without the appearance of the parties if —
(a) a party objects to all or part of the proceeding being conducted in this manner; and
(b) the Tribunal is satisfied that the objection is not reasonable.

All compensation applications will be listed for a hearing, and you will receive further directions
from VCAT.

Dear Chawakorn,

Following instructions from the rental provider, we are now arranging to proceed with the required
repairs to the water-damaged wall and flooring. These works are necessary to prevent further
deterioration of the property.
To ensure works can commence without further delay, please expect a formal Notice of Entry to be
issued on Monday, 16 June 2025. This is in accordance with the Residential Tenancies Act and will
confirm the entry date and time for the Owners CorporationÕs contractors to attend.
As previously advised, the repair process is estimated to take approximately 7Ð12 days. If you
have any preferred times or specific availability for the week ahead, please feel free to share this
by 12:00 PM Monday, 16 June, and weÕll do our best to coordinate accordingly. However, please
note that access must be provided to prevent further damage and comply with maintenance
obligations.
In terms of rent compensation, a rent credit of $800 will be applied and reflected on your ledger.
This offer has been confirmed by the rental provider as final, with no further compensation to be
considered.
If you feel the current tenancy no longer suits your circumstances, the owner is open to discussing
a mutual lease termination, without penalty, should you wish to explore that option.
Please donÕt hesitate to reach out with any further questions or concerns Ñ we remain committed
to a timely and fair resolution.

Hi Chawakorn & Matthew,

Good afternoon and hope you all are well.
Quick update, we have served 3 x notice of entry today via registered post (please refer to the files attached).
FIXD will need access to the property at 8AM on 7 July 2025, and for the rest of the week as mentioned in the notice.

This will be the first stage of remediation work, which is to treat the mould and bring the moisture level down.
They might not need to be in the property for the entire 9 hours in the first few days, but they will need access to
check the moisture level in daily basis.
Please be advised that if FIXD is unable to commence the work due to deny of access, the minimum labour charge
applies and the cost will be forwarded to you.

Please let us know if you have any questions about this. Thank you.

Hi Matthew & Chawakorn,

Good morning and hope you are well.
I have received the reply from FIXD Trade Group – contractor appointed by the OC for the repair.
I have asked for the project timeline, and below is the reply:

Please see below extract from our scope of works sent to Highrise Strata.

The drying process is essential for ensuring all affected building materials return to pre-loss moisture levels. However,
the length of drying time may vary depending on external factors such as weather conditions and moisture content.
FIXD is not responsible for delays in drying due to uncontrollable factors. Monitoring will be conducted daily, and any
necessary adjustments/cost variations will be communicated promptly. FIXD will not be held responsible for any preexisting conditions discovered during the course of remediation, including but not limited to structural defects, noncompliant installations, or prior water damage. Any discoveries will be communicated to the insured, and additional
works may be required outside the scope of this project.
We cannot provide a timeline as per your request due to the existing site constraints and nature of the damages.
Please note, once drying equipment is on-site, it is charged per day. If access is not provided as required by our team,
extra charges may be applicable to the renters for not providing access.

Hi Chawakorn,
Since no access was given on 24 June 2025, the contractor has sent us the attached invoice.
Please advise whether you would like to pay them directly.
Otherwise, the OC will settle with FIXD and on-charge the amount to Lot 1803A, and the rental provider will be
seeking reimbursement from you.
Please advise, thank you.

Subject: Without Prejudice - Formal Demand for Remedial Action and Rent Compensation

Dear Sylvia,

Without prejudice, I write to you in good faith with the intent to resolve this matter amicably, without
escalation to proceedings under the Residential Tenancies Act 1997 (VIC).

As previously notified in writing on multiple occasions, the severe water damage affecting the
bedroom in Unit 1803 has rendered that part of the premises functionally unusable. This has
substantially interfered with my ability to enjoy the premises peacefully, as protected under s.67 of
the Act.

Accordingly, I make the following formal demand to be addressed without further delay:

1. Rectification Works:
A binding written commitment specifying commencement and completion dates for all necessary
repairs, including plaster replacement, carpet remediation, and mould treatment where applicable.

2. Rent Compensation (30%):
I request a rent reduction of 30% commencing from 15 April 2025 until the affected bedroom is fully
restored and safe for normal use. This percentage is based on the fact that 1 out of 2 bedrooms (i.e.
50% of the private quarters) has been rendered unusable for essential residential functions due to
water damage, odour, and potential health hazards from prolonged dampness.

In line with sections 207(1)(c) and 210 of the Act, the Tribunal has the discretion to order rent
reduction where part of the premises is unfit for occupation, regardless of whether the rental
provider is at fault. The 30% requested is proportional, reasonable, and evidence-based.

3. Tenant Liability:
A written confirmation that I bear no responsibility for any of the costs associated with rectification
works, as the damage has originated from common building infrastructure, which falls under the
responsibility of the Owners Corporation.

If all of the above items are confirmed in writing within five (5) business days, I am prepared to
consider the matter fully resolved and will continue the tenancy in good faith.

Failing this, I reserve my right to initiate proceedings before VCAT under section 452 of the Act,
seeking urgent repairs and compensation for loss of amenity and breach of statutory duties.

All future correspondence regarding this matter must be in writing.

Sincerely,

Chawakorn Kamnuansil

Move-Out Guide
Moving can be a mixture of emo ons: excitement for the next chapter, nostalgia for the memories
you're leaving behind, and the natural stress that comes with change. However, with proper
planning and organiza on, the process can be streamlined and less overwhelming. This guide aims
to provide you with step-by-step instruc ons to ensure that your move-out goes as smoothly as
possible.
Booking Your Move-Out
• For those vaca ng a development, it's a requirement to schedule your move-out date and
me with the building manager promptly.
• Many developments require move-out pre-bookings to facilitate li protec on and assign a
designated li . Without this pre-booking, you might encounter disrup ons due to other
residents' reserva ons.
Tips for a Prompt Bond Return
• Power Connec on: We recommend keeping the power connected for three business
days a er you return your keys. This will allow the nal inspec on to be completed with
the power on. If the power is disconnected, we will need to establish a new connec on,
which may delay the bond return.
• Professional Cleaning: Cleaning a property can be more me-consuming than expected. For
peace of mind and thoroughness, consider hiring a professional cleaning service. Please refer
to the end-of-lease cleaning checklist. We recommend the following two cleaning services,
both of which have consistently delivered excep onal results for our renters.

Property Damage: If there's any accidental damage, ensure it's addressed before returning
the keys. Only use quali ed tradespeople for repairs to guarantee quality. Should DIY repairs
not meet expected standards, it might lead to bond deduc ons.
Carpet Concerns: Standard cleaning services o en only o er carpet shampooing & don’t
have the ability to remove stains. If you have stained the carpet, it is recommended that you
seek services for specialised stain removal. Crystal Clean has achieved some great results for
our renters. Contact them to discuss any concerns.

Storage Cages: If applicable, ensure your storage cage is emp ed, cleaned, and padlocks
removed.
Car space: If your car has had an oil leak, ensure you have the oil stain removed. Please
make sure the car space is clean with no belongings or rubbish le behind.

•

•
•

Keys & Remotes: Return all items provided at the beginning of your tenancy to the o ce. If
anything is missing, no fy your property manager as soon as possible so they can arrange a
replacement.
Rubbish: Do not leave rubbish inside or around the property. Any viola on of the owner’s
corpora on rules, such as unauthorized disposal, could lead to addi onal fees.
Personal Items: Double-check every area, including drawers and cupboards, to ensure no
personal items get le behind.

Handy Tips
• Wall Marks: A 'Chux Magic Eraser', which is available at outlets like Coles or Woolworths, is
ideal for mark removal. Always adhere to its usage instruc ons for op mal results.
• Light Globes: Make sure to replace non-func onal globes throughout the premises. If
overlooked, there might be electrician charges for replacements.

Residential Tenancies Act 1997
Section 91ZZO(a)

(Regulation 37)

NOTICE TO VACATE TO RENTER OF RENTED PREMISES
INFORMATION FOR RENTERS

1. This is a notice to vacate. It tells you that the residential rental provider (rental provider) wants you to
move out by a certain date. You can find details of this date in clause 10 "Termination date" below.
2. Challenging this notice - You may be able to challenge this Notice at the Victorian Civil and Administrative
Tribunal (VCAT). Reasons to challenge a notice include:
 you believe you were given this notice due to unlawful discrimination or because you tried to exercise
your rights as a renter; or
 you believe it was not given to you properly; or
 you disagree with the reason given or the information in the form is incorrect or incomplete; or
 you have experienced family or personal violence and this caused the behavior listed in the notice to
vacate. In this case, you should apply to VCAT within 30 days after the notice has been given.
Specific timeframes may apply to certain reasons to challenge a notice. You may also challenge the validity of
the notice if the rental provider applies to VCAT for a possession order.
You should seek advice if you are considering challenging a notice to vacate.
3. Unpaid Rent
If you received a notice because you have not paid your rent  If you pay all of the unpaid rent on or before the termination date in the notice, this notice has no effect.
 However, this does not apply if you have been given four earlier notices to vacate for rent arrears within
a twelve-month period that starts either on the date your agreement commenced or the anniversary of
that date.
 You can find out more about this type of notice to vacate on the Consumer Affairs Victoria website.
4. Possession orders and warrants - Rental providers must give you the appropriate notice to vacate before they
apply to VCAT for a possession order.
If you do not vacate on the date stated in the notice, the rental provider may apply to VCAT asking for an order
requiring you to leave (a possession order). VCAT will notify you of a hearing date that you can attend. You are
encouraged to attend the hearing.
At the hearing, VCAT decides whether the rental provider was entitled to give you a notice to vacate. VCAT will
make a possession order if it is satisfied that it is reasonable and proportionate to do so. VCAT may consider
whether the notice to vacate was given in response to the act of a person who has subjected you to family or
personal violence. It may also consider whether you can comply with a payment plan for any rental arrears, if
applicable.
VCAT will decide if you must leave the property and on what date that should occur. You may ask for more time
in the property if you will be in hardship. Rental providers cannot personally use force to remove you if you
refuse to leave the property. Only Victoria Police can carry out a forcible eviction, and only when they are acting
on a VCAT order (a warrant for possession).
5. Ending the residential rental agreement earlier - In some cases, you may be able to end the residential rental
agreement (rental agreement) earlier than the termination date in the notice to vacate, if the notice is given for
one of the following reasons:
Repairs or renovations; demolition; change of use of premises; occupation by the rental provider or their family;
the premises are to be sold; the premises are required for a public purpose; the renter no longer meets the
eligibility criteria; or in the case of a fixed term rental agreement, to specify a termination date that is on or after
the date of the end of the initial fixed term of the agreement.
To notify the rental provider, use a Notice of intention to vacate form and provide at least 14 days notice.
6. Seeking advice - If you think you have grounds to challenge a notice to vacate at VCAT you should seek
advice immediately by contacting one of the community legal organisations listed on the Consumer Affairs
Victoria website. For further information visit the renting section of the Consumer Affairs Victoria website at
consumer.vic.gov.au/renting or call 1300 558 181.

just from the Act or from the reasons on the information sheet; this must be accompanied by
specific details.
 VCAT may find a notice to vacate invalid where it does not provide enough details or is not
accompanied by the required documentary evidence.
I am giving you this notice for the following reason:
Section 91ZL Unsafe premises
The premises are unfit for human habitation or have been destroyed totally, or to such an extent as to be
rendered unsafe.
A roof leak from common property caused water to enter the bedroom, resulting in swollen plaster, bubbling
paint, and visible mould. On 23 May 2025, contractor FIXD Trade Group inspected and confirmed the room is
unsafe. Urgent mould remediation is required, including sealing the room, chemical treatment, and drying using
industrial equipment. Drying is expected to take 7 days, followed by reinstatement of plaster and painting, with
the full process taking up to 14 days.
The property will be unsafe and unsuitable to occupy during this time due to noise, equipment use, and health
risks. Despite multiple written requests, the renter has refused access, preventing critical repairs.
This Notice to Vacate is issued to allow urgent works and restore the property to a habitable standard. The

renter is required to vacate by 14 July 2025.
In many cases this notice must be accompanied by documentary evidence. For information on documentary
evidence go to www.consumer.vic.gov.au/ntv
Is documentary evidence attached? Yes
Please provide details of the evidence attached:

12. Delivery of this notice
 The notice period begins the day after the renter is estimated to receive this notice.
 If sending by post, the rental provider must allow for the delivery time in calculating the proposed
termination date.
 If sending by registered post, the rental provider should keep evidence of the mail delivery method used
to send this notice.

===== START FILE: ./Perspective_From_Chawakorn-Podjana.txt =====
Podjana Tienmon — Perspective
I am a co‑tenant at Unit 1803. I share the tenancy with Chawakorn but I
occupy a different bedroom. The mould and water‑damage problem arose in
his bedroom, not mine. My room was not the source of the issue, and I was
not responsible for the underlying problem.
When the agent issued a notice to vacate, I felt I was being swept into a
process I did not cause. I had complied with my obligations and looked
after my room and shared spaces. Being asked to leave on the basis of an
“unsafe premises” notice—without particulars showing a whole‑premises
danger—felt unfair to me as a co‑tenant whose bedroom was unaffected.
English is not my first language, and navigating technical emails and
formal steps has been stressful. I depend on stable housing to support my
daily life, and sudden eviction threatens my safety and wellbeing. I am
willing to cooperate fully with access for repairs and any reasonable
program to fix the damage. What I am asking for is simple: do not punish
me for a problem that was not in my room and that can be managed through
a structured remediation plan. I want repairs done properly, with clear
scheduling, and without an eviction that would harm me despite my lack of
involvement in the cause.
Chawakorn Kamnuansil — Perspective
I am an international student and the co‑tenant in the bedroom where the
water‑damage and mould were found. I first reported the issue after
noticing a strong smell and visible wall problems. Contractors later
inspected and proposed a remediation plan that involved containment of my
bedroom, removal of affected materials, decontamination, drying for
several days, and follow‑up verification. They indicated my bedroom would
be unusable during the works and suggested temporary accommodation for
that period. They also noted I could return between stages of the works,
which implies the rest of the unit could remain habitable while the
bedroom is sealed and treated.
Throughout this period, I sought to do things correctly: I raised the
issue, cooperated with inspection, and looked for a safe, practical
solution. Receiving a notice to vacate framed as “unsafe premises,”
without clear particulars about whole‑premises unfitness, felt wrong—
especially when a contained remediation option was already described. I
want the remediation to proceed safely and promptly, with proper access
and scheduling, and with temporary accommodation for the period my room
is sealed. I am not trying to obstruct repairs; I am asking for a fair
process that targets the affected area rather than evicting both tenants
on short notice. My goal is safe completion of the works and to continue
my studies and tenancy without being forced out for a problem that can be
managed through the plan already described.

to me, Areal, Cases@courts.vic.gov.au, bewty980219@gmail.com, Sylvia ”

Hi Chawakorn,

Good evening and hope you're both doing well.

I'm following up on my previous email regarding the compensation from the OC.
Please know that I'm here to assist and help explore the best possible options for you.

At the end of the day, our shared goal is to have the issue resolved as quickly and smoothly as possible.
| completely understand your concerns about staying in the property during the repair work.
When FIXD inspected the property back in May, the initial estimate for the job duration was over 7 — 10 days.

However, due to the delays, the condition might have been deteriorated. Hence, FIXD is unable to provide a timeframe of the work.

As | have not yet received a confirmed response from the OC regarding the $800 compensation offer, | would like to outline some options for you to consider:

4. Seek temporary accommodation during the works, and submit a reimbursement claim to the OC, who is ultimately responsible for the leak. While this is a valid option, | must note that we cannot guarantee the outcome of their approval.
2. Early lease termination without penalty. If you feel the property will be uninhabitable during the repairs and would prefer not to take the risk of seeking compensation from the OC, the rental provider is willing to allow you to break the fixed-term lease
early with no penalties.

3. If you would like to further escalate this, you can have the OC joined as a party to residential tenancy application at VCAT

Please let us know which option you would prefer, or if there’s anything else we can do to support you.
Thank you again, and wishing you a pleasant evening.

Kind Regards,
Johnson Tan

Tenant Statement of Verbal Communications and Delayed Repairs

I, Chawakorn Kamnuansil, tenant of Unit 1803 at 243 Franklin Street, Melbourne VIC, provide this
statement in relation to a phone call I received from the managing agent (Areal Property) around 2-3
June 2025, and the ongoing failure to rectify serious water damage in my unit.

1. During the call, I was informed that a dehumidifier would be installed in the damaged bedroom,
and that it would emit continuous noise and operate 24/7. I was advised that it would be better for
me and my roommate to temporarily vacate the property.

2. I was asked whether I could stay with nearby friends or relatives. I replied that I could not and
would not, because it is not my responsibility to resolve a crisis created by agency inaction. I also
noted that the agency had not provided any alternative accommodation options.

3. The agency stated that if I were to seek temporary accommodation, it would only be reimbursed if
the cost did not exceed the current rent ($2,825/month). This is impractical-my roommate and I are
not in a personal relationship and cannot share a single room. Finding two separate rooms for a
short-term stay in Melbourne under $700/week is not realistic.

4. I acknowledged that the landlord had offered temporary accommodation at a residence in Mount
Waverley, but I declined. My life and work are based in the city, and relocation would severely
impact my routine. I asked if other options existed. The agent replied that the "final option" would be
for me to terminate the lease early.

5. I made it clear that I would not terminate the lease. I have taken exceptional care of the property. I
clean regularly, report issues promptly, and had no part in causing this damage. The water intrusion
was first reported in mid-April. Had repairs been actioned swiftly, the situation would not have

escalated to the current level.

6. I lived through the consequences-damp smells, wall stains, an unusable bedroom-without any
real assistance. I feared undertaking repairs myself in case I became liable. I used air purifiers and
candles daily just to remain inside the apartment.

7. Two months later, no significant progress has been made. I am now being pressured with
unsuitable options. I respectfully ask why no urgency was shown when I first raised this matter. Had
action been taken earlier, extensive damage could have been avoided.

This statement is true to the best of my knowledge and made in good faith.

Signed,
Chawakorn Kamnuansil

Application under Residential Tenancies Act 1997 challenging validity of notice to vacate - residential
Section 91ZZS
______________________________________________________________________________________
VCAT finds:
1.

The applicants have filed an application under section 91ZZS of the Residential Tenancies Act 1997
challenging the validity of a notice to vacate.

2.

The notice to vacate in question was given to the renter under section 91ZL of the Residential
Tenancies Act 1997.

3.

Section 91ZZS of the Residential Tenancies Act 1997 specifies that a renter may apply to challenge
the validity of a notice to vacate given under section 91ZX , 91ZY, 91ZZ, 91ZZA, 91ZZB or 91ZZC.
It does not allow a renter to challenge the validity of a notice to vacate given under section 91ZL.

4.

Pursuant to section 75 of the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal Act 1998, the Tribunal has
formed the view on the material before it, that the application is misconceived.

5.

The renters cannot preemptively challenge the notice to vacate. However, the renters can still
challenge the validity of the notice to vacate under section 91ZZI of the Act if the residential
rental provider applies for a possession order on the basis of the 91ZL notice to vacate
issued on 11 July 2025.

6.

The Tribunal notes that if the parties can agree on an arrangement for the renters to move
out for about 14 days, the repairs could be completed and the renters could return to the
premises.

VCAT orders:
1.

The application is struck out with a right to apply for reinstatement.

Note:

If the applicants apply for reinstatement they must provide details of why the strike out order is
opposed, including a response to the findings made by the Tribunal above.

Select the issue(s) with the property:
Flooding or serious flood damage:
Water damage discovered on 16 April 2025 in bedroom above bed area. Wall bulge
appeared and spread rapidly from ceiling to floor within 24 hours. Source identified as hot
water system leak in ceiling on 28 April 2025. Bedroom has been unusable for over 2
months due to persistent moisture, mold growth, structural damage, and safety concerns.
Complete remediation including wall restoration and carpet replacement has not been
completed.
Property Propdoes not meet?minimum standards:
Bedroom fails to meet minimum standards under Residential Tenancies Act due to: (1)
Unusable sleeping area for 2+ months, (2) Persistent moisture and mold creating health
hazards, (3) Structural damage compromising safety, (4) Inadequate ventilation causing
ongoing damp conditions. Property manager has failed to restore habitability within
reasonable timeframe despite multiple requests.
Water services (burst):
Hot water system leak in ceiling identified on 28 April 2025 by plumber. Initial leak caused
extensive water damage to bedroom wall and flooring. While source leak reportedly fixed,
internal damage including wall restoration, mold remediation, and carpet replacement
remains incomplete. Water damage continues to impact habitability of bedroom.
Unsafe or insecure fault or damage in the property: including?pests, mould or
damp?caused by or related to the building structure:
Ongoing mold growth and damp conditions in bedroom creating health hazards. Structural
wall damage from water ingress compromises safety. Persistent musty odors and poor air
quality documented in medical certificate from Era Health dated 23 June 2025. Bedroom
remains uninhabitable due to safety and health concerns from unresolved water damage.
Steps taken to resolve the issue:
Water damage was first reported on 16 April 2025. Property management was transferred
from Hilary Ho to Sylvia Hao on the same day without addressing the urgent issue. Multiple
follow-up emails were sent on 20 April, 23 April, and throughout May 2025. A plumber
identified the source as a hot water system leak on 28 April 2025, but complete repairs
including wall restoration, mold remediation, and carpet replacement have not been
completed. The bedroom remains unusable for over 2 months. Repairs are now scheduled

for 24 June 2025 at 8:30 AM with no alternative accommodation provided.
Have you raised the issue(s) in writing with your rental provider or real estate agent:
Yes

How do you want this dispute to be resolved:

1. Immediate provision of alternative accommodation during repair period
2. Compensation for rent paid while bedroom was unusable (approximately $1,400-1,500
per month for 2+ months)
3. Complete restoration of property to habitable condition
4. Protection orders preventing retaliation
5. Assurance that all future repairs will be completed within reasonable timeframes
6. Compensation for stress, inconvenience, and health impacts as documented by medical
certificate

I want VCAT to redirect my rent payments into a Rent Special Account until repairs
are completed

NOTICE TO VACATE TO RENTER OF RENTED PREMISES
INFORMATION FOR RENTERS

1. This is a notice to vacate. It tells you that the residential rental provider (rental provider) wants you to
move out by a certain date. You can find details of this date in clause 10 "Termination date" below.
2. Challenging this notice - You may be able to challenge this Notice at the Victorian Civil and Administrative
Tribunal (VCAT). Reasons to challenge a notice include:
 you believe you were given this notice due to unlawful discrimination or because you tried to exercise
your rights as a renter; or
 you believe it was not given to you properly; or
 you disagree with the reason given or the information in the form is incorrect or incomplete; or
 you have experienced family or personal violence and this caused the behavior listed in the notice to
vacate. In this case, you should apply to VCAT within 30 days after the notice has been given.
Specific timeframes may apply to certain reasons to challenge a notice. You may also challenge the validity of
the notice if the rental provider applies to VCAT for a possession order.
You should seek advice if you are considering challenging a notice to vacate.
3. Unpaid Rent
If you received a notice because you have not paid your rent  If you pay all of the unpaid rent on or before the termination date in the notice, this notice has no effect.
 However, this does not apply if you have been given four earlier notices to vacate for rent arrears within
a twelve-month period that starts either on the date your agreement commenced or the anniversary of
that date.
 You can find out more about this type of notice to vacate on the Consumer Affairs Victoria website.
4. Possession orders and warrants - Rental providers must give you the appropriate notice to vacate before they
apply to VCAT for a possession order.
If you do not vacate on the date stated in the notice, the rental provider may apply to VCAT asking for an order
requiring you to leave (a possession order). VCAT will notify you of a hearing date that you can attend. You are
encouraged to attend the hearing.
At the hearing, VCAT decides whether the rental provider was entitled to give you a notice to vacate. VCAT will
make a possession order if it is satisfied that it is reasonable and proportionate to do so. VCAT may consider
whether the notice to vacate was given in response to the act of a person who has subjected you to family or
personal violence. It may also consider whether you can comply with a payment plan for any rental arrears, if
applicable.
VCAT will decide if you must leave the property and on what date that should occur. You may ask for more time
in the property if you will be in hardship. Rental providers cannot personally use force to remove you if you
refuse to leave the property. Only Victoria Police can carry out a forcible eviction, and only when they are acting
on a VCAT order (a warrant for possession).
5. Ending the residential rental agreement earlier - In some cases, you may be able to end the residential rental
agreement (rental agreement) earlier than the termination date in the notice to vacate, if the notice is given for
one of the following reasons:
Repairs or renovations; demolition; change of use of premises; occupation by the rental provider or their family;
the premises are to be sold; the premises are required for a public purpose; the renter no longer meets the
eligibility criteria; or in the case of a fixed term rental agreement, to specify a termination date that is on or after
the date of the end of the initial fixed term of the agreement.
To notify the rental provider, use a Notice of intention to vacate form and provide at least 14 days notice.
6. Seeking advice - If you think you have grounds to challenge a notice to vacate at VCAT you should seek
advice immediately by contacting one of the community legal organisations listed on the Consumer Affairs
Victoria website. For further information visit the renting section of the Consumer Affairs Victoria website at
consumer.vic.gov.au/renting or call 1300 558 181.

Note: If you want to challenge this notice you should seek legal advice as soon as possible.
11. Reason for notice
 The rental provider must select the relevant reason, section number and the minimum notice
required under the act.
 The rental provider must also explain why the notice has been given. It is not enough to quote
just from the Act or from the reasons on the information sheet; this must be accompanied by
specific details.
 VCAT may find a notice to vacate invalid where it does not provide enough details or is not
accompanied by the required documentary evidence.
I am giving you this notice for the following reason:
Section 91ZL Unsafe premises
The premises are unfit for human habitation or have been destroyed totally, or to such an extent as to be
rendered unsafe.
A roof leak from common property caused water to enter the bedroom, resulting in swollen plaster, bubbling
paint, and visible mould. On 23 May 2025, contractor FIXD Trade Group inspected and confirmed the room is
unsafe. Urgent mould remediation is required, including sealing the room, chemical treatment, and drying using
industrial equipment. Drying is expected to take 7 days, followed by reinstatement of plaster and painting, with
the full process taking up to 14 days.
The property will be unsafe and unsuitable to occupy during this time due to noise, equipment use, and health
risks. Despite multiple written requests, the renter has refused access, preventing critical repairs.
This Notice to Vacate is issued to allow urgent works and restore the property to a habitable standard. The

renter is required to vacate by 14 July 2025.
In many cases this notice must be accompanied by documentary evidence. For information on documentary
evidence go to www.consumer.vic.gov.au/ntv
Is documentary evidence attached? Yes
Please provide details of the evidence attached:
Message Thread Franklin Street (PDF)
This includes a detailed email thread between the managing agent, contractor (FIXD Trade Group), and the
Owners Corporation. It provides:
Confirmation of mould presence and safety concerns
Scope of remediation works (drying, sealing, chemical treatment)
Estimated timeline for drying (7 days) plus reinstatement
Statement that the property is unsafe and inaccessible during the works
Contractor recommendation for the tenant to vacate
12. Delivery of this notice
 The notice period begins the day after the renter is estimated to receive this notice.
 If sending by post, the rental provider must allow for the delivery time in calculating the proposed
termination date.
 If sending by registered post, the rental provider should keep evidence of the mail delivery method used
to send this notice.
This notice was sent on 11 July 2025
This notice will be delivered

Hi Matthew,
We would like to bring to your attention that over the past few weeks, we have made every reasonable effort
to coordinate with the Owners Corporation (OC) and the appointed contractor, FIXD, to facilitate essential
repair works at the property. This is now our second attempt to proceed with the repairs. To clarify, all
relevant parties – including the OC, FIXD, our agency as the managing agent, and the rental provider are fully
committed to commencing and completing the necessary repairs as promptly as possible.
Page 2 of 4

We are more than willing to provide any further information the renter may reasonably request to facilitate
cooperation. However, we respectfully request that VCAT take into account that we are NOT the party
impeding progress.

Hi Chawakorn,
Please refer to below response in blue, as I have communicated with FIXD prior to this email.
I will get the remaining requested details from FIXD, but I can’t guarantee that they will reply within 24 hours.
Given that coordinating this repair requires the involvement of multiple parties and significant resources, your
cooperation is not only appreciated but essential to ensure the work can proceed without further delay.
Thank you.

Dear Johnson,
Your three Section-86 notices, lodged by registered post on 27 June 2025, seek entry at
08:00 AM on 7, 8 and 9 July—only **12 days’** lead time—and leave the “Details attached” box
unchecked. Entry therefore remains conditional.
SEND WITHIN 24 HOURS
1. Contractor legal name, licence number & 24-hour mobile – Pending FIXD’s reply
2. Day-by-day work scope (rooms, tasks, time estimates) for the full 7-day schedule The first stage of the
repair involves reducing the moisture levels in the affected bedroom, as outlined in the Notice of Entry. During
this drying process, the contractor will require daily access to the room in order to monitor and record
moisture readings. At this stage, they are unable to provide specific time estimates for this phase, as the
duration will depend on how quickly acceptable moisture levels are reached. Once the area has dried
sufficiently, they will proceed with the necessary repair work. Please note that because the contractor has not
yet assessed the current site conditions in full, they are unable to provide a definitive timeline or scope for the
repairs at this time.
3. Risk statement – water / power interruptions & noise levels - Pending FIXD’s reply
4. Public-liability / PI insurance certificate - Pending FIXD’s reply
5. “Tax invoice.pdf” **and** the alleged “tenant-confirmation” screenshot FIXD has been engaged by the
Owners Corporation, as the source of the leak originates from a common area. The OC will cover the cost of
the repairs once the work is completed. At this stage, FIXD is unable to provide a quote, as they have not yet
been able to assess the current site conditions in detail. Could you please clarify what you mean by a “tenantconfirmation screenshot”?
6. Daily-rate schedule for drying equipment **plus** written assurance that no
“no-access” surcharge will be levied without a Tribunal order As previously mentioned, FIXD is the
contractor appointed by the Owners Corporation (OC), and the OC will be covering the cost of the scheduled
works. Could you please clarify the relevance of the “daily-rate schedule for drying equipment”? There will be
no additional charges incurred, provided FIXD is granted access in accordance with the Notice of Entry and
Page 3 of 4

there are no delays caused by restricted access or obstruction to the repair process.

_No bundle → No entry → Call-out fee remains fictional._
**Provisional window (if items 1-6 arrive):** **Wed 9 Jul 2025, 15 : 30 – 19 : 00 AEST**
**Retaliatory warning** Your 27 Jun 15 : 09 email (“…deduct from your bond…”) breaches
s 264 RTA. Any repeat—or any attempt to impose daily drying fees without prior disclosure—
will trigger my application for penalty units and costs.
**Non-confirmation notice** Until items 1-6 are supplied, this email does **not** constitute
consent.
Key verbatim excerpts for easy reference:
• *Exh A – 16 Jun 04 : 37 (tenant)* “any update … I’ll reply before 12 : 00 …”
• *Exh B – 16 Jun 11 : 52 (agent)* “Thanks so much … **for confirming** …”
• *Exh C – 23 Jun 14 : 35 (agent)* “remediation work … 24 Jun 08 : 30 … provide access …”
• *Exh D – 27 Jun 15 : 09 (agent)* “**we will deduct it from your bond**.”
Your own notices concede the job “might be extended subject to the length of the drying
process” yet provide no timeline or cost caps. Please resolve that conflict by supplying
items 1-6 above.

Hi Chawakorn,
Good evening and hope you're both doing well.
IÕm following up on my previous email regarding the compensation from the OC.
Please know that IÕm here to assist and help explore the best possible options for you.
At the end of the day, our shared goal is to have the issue resolved as quickly and smoothly as possible.
Page 2 of 4

I completely understand your concerns about staying in the property during the repair work.
When FIXD inspected the property back in May, the initial estimate for the job duration was over 7 Ð 10 days.
However, due to the delays, the condition might have been deteriorated. Hence, FIXD is unable to provide a
timeframe of the work.
As I have not yet received a confirmed response from the OC regarding the $800 compensation offer, I would
like to outline some options for you to consider:
1. Seek temporary accommodation during the works, and submit a reimbursement claim to the OC, who is
ultimately responsible for the leak. While this is a valid option, I must note that we cannot guarantee the
outcome of their approval.
2. Early lease termination without penalty. If you feel the property will be uninhabitable during the repairs
and would prefer not to take the risk of seeking compensation from the OC, the rental provider is willing to
allow you to break the fixed-term lease early with no penalties.
3. If you would like to further escalate this, you can have the OC joined as a party to residential tenancy
application at VCAT
Please let us know which option you would prefer, or if thereÕs anything else we can do to support you.
Thank you again, and wishing you a pleasant evening.

Hi Chawakorn,
Thank you for your email.
I would like to seek clarification on one thing, which I havenÕt received a certain answer yet.
I can see that there is a $800 compensation, offered by the OC.
Is that compensation amount meant to be compensating the inconvenience during the work?
If so, I believe that is the reason why the OC didnÕt offer an alternative accommodation for this job.
If no, can you please forward the email of you rejecting that offer?
Thank you Chawakorn.

Dear Sylvia,

I am writing with the intent of resolving this matter constructively and without escalation, if possible.

Over the past two months, I have reported the water damage issue multiple times in good faith, cooperated with your office, and done my best to
remain in the property despite the difficulties. I am not trying to be confrontational; I simply need a clear and reasonable outcome, supported by
appropriate action and communication.

Please find attached:
1. A formal demand letter outlining my request for rent compensation, a firm repair timeline, and confirmation of non-liability Ð based on my rights
under the Residential Tenancies Act 1997 (VIC).
2. A supporting tenant statement summarising the verbal communication with your office around 2Ð3 June 2025, including the temporary
accommodation proposal and its impractical conditions.

If a fair and written resolution is not reached within five (5) business days, I will have no choice but to initiate proceedings through VCAT. I sincerely
hope this can be avoided and that we can achieve a reasonable solution for all parties involved.

I would appreciate your written response at your earliest convenience.

Dear Chawakorn,
Thank you for your email and the supporting documents outlining your concerns and formal request.
We understand the impact this situation has had on your tenancy and appreciate the way youÕve approached the matter. We will now forward your
request and documentation to the Owners Corporation for consideration of a rent compensation claim based on the current circumstances.
In the meantime, we are aiming to proceed with the repair works as soon as possible. Could you kindly confirm whether works can commence on
Thursday, 6 June 2025, or let us know your earliest availability to provide access?
We will continue to keep you updated as we receive further information from the Owners Corporation.
Kind regards,

Dear Sylvia,
Thank you for your response dated Friday, 6 June 2025 at 11:50am.
As the primary resident of the property who has lived through weeks of unresolved water damage, I must reiterate that no one is more eager than I
am to see the situation resolved quickly and properly. However, I am currently unable to provide consent for any repair work to begin.
Firstly, your email referred to repairs commencing on "Thursday, 6 June"a date which had already passed at the time of your message. This
inconsistency is not just confusing; it is logistically impossible and calls into question the seriousness of the repair planning. Such unclear and lastminute communication cannot form the basis for valid consent.

Page 2 of 13

Secondly, I must emphasise that I cannot authorise access until the following points are clearly confirmed in writing:
1. A definitive and specific repair timeline, including projected completion date.
2. Whether temporary relocation will be required, and if so, what arrangements or compensation are being offered.
3. Your position on my formal request for rent reduction and confirmation of non-liability, which remain outstanding.
4. Acknowledgment of the impact on my co-tenant, who is also named in the lease agreement, and who will equally be affected by noise and
accessibility issues related to the drying equipment.
It is my responsibility to ensure that any agreement made does not inadvertently waive our legal rights or create further hardship. I must act
cautiously, especially as the installation of industrial drying equipment operating 24/7 poses real disturbancessomething your office acknowledged in
our previous phone call.
If I were to consent now without these matters resolved in writing, it could later be used to suggest that I accepted all resulting conditions, which I
absolutely do not.
Therefore, I will only provide access once I receive formal written confirmation addressing all points above. Until then, I consider it unreasonable to
demand a commitment from me, especially under these unclear and one-sided circumstances.
As noted in my formal demand, if a resolution is not reached within five (5) calendar daysincluding weekendsI will proceed to file an application with
VCAT.
Kind regards,
Chawakorn Kamnuansil

Dear Chawakorn,
Thank you for your email and for clearly outlining your concerns. We completely understand the frustration and inconvenience this ongoing issue has
caused, and we truly appreciate your patience.
Repair Timeline:
We have formally submitted your 30% rent reduction request to the Owners Corporation and are awaiting their response. Once we receive their
feedback, we will provide you with a confirmed repair timeline and projected completion date.
Temporary Relocation:
As discussed, the affected bedroom will need to be vacant during the repair work, including the installation of drying equipment.
Co-Tenant Impact:
We recognize that your co-tenant will also be affected by these repairs. Please rest assured that we will keep both of you informed about the repair
schedule and any potential disruptions.
We fully respect your decision to withhold consent until these matters are fully addressed in writing. We are working to resolve this as quickly as
possible and will provide all the necessary details as soon as they are available.
If you have any further questions or need additional clarification, please donÕt hesitate to reach out.

Re: Rent Adjustment Ð Request for Clarification and Meeting (12 June)

Dear Sylvia,

Thank you again for your recent update, and for forwarding the proposed rent adjustment of $800.

As IÕve mentioned previously, IÕm still very open to resolving this matter directly and as fairly as possible, given the nature and duration of the
disruption.

Before I can respond to the proposed amount, IÕd really appreciate your clarification on a few key points, just so thereÕs no confusion going forward:
¥ How exactly was the $800 figure calculated?
¥ What time period does it cover?
¥ Does it reflect one tenant or both of us?
¥ If accepted, would that payment mean I canÕt raise other issues like earlier disruption or temporary accommodation?
¥ And whatÕs the current expected repair timeline?

From my side, IÕve been looking at the impact from around 15 April, which is when the issue started and when I first reached out. So I hope that
context can be considered as part of your teamÕs preparation before we meet. It would really help if everything could be brought or explained clearly
during the discussion, so we donÕt go in circles.

To keep things moving forward, IÕd like to propose an in-person meeting at your office on Thursday, 12 June at 10:30 AM. IÕll be bringing a support
person with me as well. Nothing formal Ñ just someone to help me navigate things clearly.

If this time doesnÕt work for your team, please let me know by 9:00 AM Thursday. If I donÕt hear back by then, IÕll assume the meeting canÕt go ahead
as suggested and will take the next steps from there.

Thank you again Ñ IÕm still hopeful we can bring this to a clear and fair resolution.

Kind regards,
Chawakorn Kamnuansil

Dear Chawakorn,
I hope you're well, and thank you again for your continued engagement regarding the repair matter.
Following instructions from the rental provider, we are now arranging to proceed with the required repairs to the water-damaged wall and flooring.
These works are necessary to prevent further deterioration of the property.
To ensure works can commence without further delay, please expect a formal Notice of Entry to be issued on Monday, 16 June 2025. This is in
accordance with the Residential Tenancies Act and will confirm the entry date and time for the Owners CorporationÕs contractors to attend.
As previously advised, the repair process is estimated to take approximately 7Ð12 days. If you have any preferred times or specific availability for the
week ahead, please feel free to share this by 12:00 PM Monday, 16 June, and weÕll do our best to coordinate accordingly. However, please note that
access must be provided to prevent further damage and comply with maintenance obligations.
In terms of rent compensation, a rent credit of $800 will be applied and reflected on your ledger. This offer has been confirmed by the rental provider
as final, with no further compensation to be considered.
If you feel the current tenancy no longer suits your circumstances, the owner is open to discussing a mutual lease termination, without penalty, should
you wish to explore that option.
Please donÕt hesitate to reach out with any further questions or concerns Ñ we remain committed to a timely and fair resolution.
Warm regards,

Sylvia Hao

Good afternoon and hope you are well.
Sylvia is currently on leave and will be back on 7 July.
Just a quick reminder that the remediation work will be commenced on tomorrow (24 June) at 8:30AM.
Please ensure you will be able to provide access for the trade.
Thank you very much!

Dear Johnson,

Thank you for your message. And honestly, IÕm relieved to hear from someone new, because I donÕt feel that Sylvia Hao ever fully understood what
IÕve been trying to say from the start.

Happy holiday to Sylvia Ñ I hope sheÕs having a relaxing break. I wish I could take one too under the current circumstances.

I kindly ask you to take a moment to review my past emails. At no point did I confirm that I agreed to the works or gave consent to proceed. In fact,
IÕve repeatedly asked Sylvia for proper information and clarification, which I never received. The only thing I said was that I might be out of touch Ñ
which I clearly explained was because I needed a break from all this due to how much stress it had caused me. And now, after several days of
silence, I suddenly receive a reminder that the works are happening tomorrow?

I have no idea whatÕs going to happen to me tomorrow.

YouÕre asking me to provide access for something I was never truly consulted on. I was not given 14 daysÕ notice. And more importantly Ñ where do
you actually expect me to stay? I just paid $2,825 in rent. I have no money for a second place. I canÕt share a bedroom with my co-tenant. And no one
from your office, including Sylvia, has ever addressed that properly.

If this is the agencyÕs internal policy Ñ to carry out major internal works while offering no accommodation or practical alternatives to the tenant Ñ then
please confirm that to me clearly. It would actually be helpful for me to have that confirmed, because I have now submitted this matter to VCAT and
am preparing to provide a complete record of whatÕs happened.

Again, I am not refusing access. I am simply asking a question that no one has answered: where am I supposed to stay?

Also, please do not attempt to contact me by phone. I will not answer any calls. All communication must be in writing by email, as phone calls cannot
be recorded or documented for evidence purposes.

Chawakorn Kamnuansil

Hi Chawakorn,
Thank you for your reply. I want to start by sincerely apologising for the inconvenience and frustration this ongoing issue has caused you. I truly
understand how disruptive this must be, and I appreciate your continued patience throughout.
After reviewing the communication trail, I want to clarify that the source of the leak originates from a common area of the building, which falls under
the Owners Corporation's (OC) responsibility. As a result, all scheduling and repair works need to be coordinated through them. Unfortunately, this
has contributed to the delays, and I understand how frustrating that can be.
To address your first question: Sylvia did send an email on 18 June 2025 to both you and Podjana once the OC confirmed the appointment details.
IÕve attached a screenshot of that email for your reference. ItÕs possible it was missed, but IÕm glad to hear that youÕll be able to provide access
tomorrow.
Regarding alternative accommodation, it was my understanding that the agreed $800 compensation was intended to help offset those costs. If IÕve
misunderstood or missed anything, please do let me knowÑthereÕs been a lot of emails, and I want to ensure nothing important is overlooked. The
amount will be set as rent credit once the repair is commenced.
Again, I truly empathise with your situation. From what IÕve seen, Sylvia has been doing her utmost to keep communication flowing between all parties
involvedÑyourself, the rental provider, the OC, and their plumber. Unfortunately, her ability to act is limited when the responsible party is not as
responsive as we would hope.
Please rest assured that we will continue to follow up closely and advocate for this to be resolved as quickly as possible.

Hi Chawakon,

Page 12 of 13

I hope you're both safe and well.
IÕve just been informed by the contractor arranged by the Owners Corporation that they were unable to carry out the scheduled repair work this
morning due to an access issue. They mentioned they rang both the intercom and your mobile but unfortunately couldnÕt get through.
After waiting for approximately an hour, they had no choice but to leave the building. As a result, they will need to charge the OC for the call-out and
arrange a new time for the job to be completed.
Our primary concern is to ensure everything is okay on your end, especially as we havenÕt heard from you today.
Please let us know that you're safe when you get a moment, and weÕll work with the OC to coordinate a new appointment as soon as possible.

Dear Johnson,
Thank you for your follow-up regarding events. I sincerely apologize for any inconvenience caused.
I want to clarify that I have never refused access for necessary repairs. The situation on 24 June occurred due to inadequate advance communication
about the specific scheduling and requirements, which left me unprepared for the visit.
I genuinely regret that the contractor's time was affected, and I understand this may have caused complications for the scheduling process.
As this matter is now being handled through the formal dispute resolution process (Case RT252398), I believe all repair coordination should proceed
through the official RDRV channel to ensure proper documentation and clarity for all parties moving forward.
I remain committed to resolving this matter constructively and cooperatively, and I look forward to working with the Resolution Coordinator to establish
an appropriate process that works for everyone involved.
Thank you for your understanding, and I apologize again for yesterday's circumstances.

Dear Chawakorn,

You have recently been issued a notice to vacate by the property owner, with a required move-out
date of 14/07/2025.

To facilitate a smooth and efficient vacating process, we kindly ask you to carefully review and follow
the instructions provided below.

Final Payments:
Your rental status is currently paid to the 22/07/2025 with $0.00 on account.
A payment of $0.00 is due and payable prior to you vacating the property for the period up to the
14/07/2025.

Where to return keys: Please return keys & a copy of any cleaning receipts to our office at 33
Camberwell Road, Hawthorn East Vic 3123 between office hours. We are open Monday to Friday
between 8.30am Ð 5.30pm during office hours. Please note, that if keys are not returned on or before
the vacate date, rent will continue to be charged at the daily rate.

Power Connection: We recommend keeping the power connected for three business days after you
return your keys. This will allow the final inspection to be completed with the power on. If the power
is disconnected, we will need to establish a new connection, which may delay the bond return.

Final Inspection: We will conduct a final inspection of the property within 3 business days of the
keys being returned. You are invited to attend the final inspection. If you would like to attend, please
let me know ASAP so I can arrange a suitable time with you.

Bond Return: To ensure a speedy return of your bond, please return the property in its original

condition, less normal wear and tear. You can expect your bond to be returned within 10 business
days. For clarity on property expectations and to expedite the bond return process, please refer to
the attached ÒMove out guide & tips to get your bond back.Ó

Utility Cancelation: Ensure that you contact all your utility providers to advise your intended vacate
date. Any bills or charges incurred after your vacate date will be your responsibility.

Cleaning: We kindly ask that you leave the property in a clean and tidy state, as outlined in the
rental agreement & as per the in-going condition report. To assist with the cleaning process, we have
attached the document labelled ÒVacate cleaning guideÕÕ to help you or your preferred cleaner.

Keys and Property Access: Please ensure that all keys, remotes, and other access devices provided
to you are returned to the office and signed back in by your vacate date. Any unreturned or lost items
will need to be replaced at your expense. Do not leave keys in the letterbox due to the risk of theft.
Renters are responsible for replacing locks and keys if they are stolen from the letterbox.

If you have any questions or need clarification on any of the above points, please don't hesitate to
reach out.

Application under Residential Tenancies Act 1997 challenging validity of notice to vacate - residential
Section 91ZZS
______________________________________________________________________________________
VCAT finds:
1.

The applicants have filed an application under section 91ZZS of the Residential Tenancies Act 1997
challenging the validity of a notice to vacate.

2.

The notice to vacate in question was given to the renter under section 91ZL of the Residential
Tenancies Act 1997.

3.

Section 91ZZS of the Residential Tenancies Act 1997 specifies that a renter may apply to challenge
the validity of a notice to vacate given under section 91ZX , 91ZY, 91ZZ, 91ZZA, 91ZZB or 91ZZC.
It does not allow a renter to challenge the validity of a notice to vacate given under section 91ZL.

4.

Pursuant to section 75 of the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal Act 1998, the Tribunal has
formed the view on the material before it, that the application is misconceived.
