Hi Chawakorn,

Good evening and hope you're both doing well.

I'm following up on my previous email regarding the compensation from the OC.
Please know that I'm here to assist and help explore the best possible options for you.

At the end of the day, our shared goal is to have the issue resolved as quickly and smoothly as possible.
| completely understand your concerns about staying in the property during the repair work.
When FIXD inspected the property back in May, the initial estimate for the job duration was over 7 — 10 days.

However, due to the delays, the condition might have been deteriorated. Hence, FIXD is unable to provide a timeframe of the work.

As | have not yet received a confirmed response from the OC regarding the $800 compensation offer, | would like to outline some options for you to consider:

4. Seek temporary accommodation during the works, and submit a reimbursement claim to the OC, who is ultimately responsible for the leak. While this is a valid option, | must note that we cannot guarantee the outcome of their approval.
2. Early lease termination without penalty. If you feel the property will be uninhabitable during the repairs and would prefer not to take the risk of seeking compensation from the OC, the rental provider is willing to allow you to break the fixed-term lease
early with no penalties.

3. If you would like to further escalate this, you can have the OC joined as a party to residential tenancy application at VCAT

Please let us know which option you would prefer, or if there’s anything else we can do to support you.
Thank you again, and wishing you a pleasant evening.

Kind Regards,
Johnson Tan
