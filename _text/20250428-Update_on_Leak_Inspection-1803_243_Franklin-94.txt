Hi Charwakorn,
Just a quick update Ã‘ the Owners Corporation will be inspecting the leak first thing tomorrow
morning.
To help them understand the exact location of the leak, could you please circle the affected area in
the attached photo for them?
Thank you, and please let me know if you have any questions.
Kind regards,

Sylvia Hao
