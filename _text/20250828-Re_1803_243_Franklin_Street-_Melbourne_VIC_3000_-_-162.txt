Hi Shaun,

I acknowledge your 22 Aug 2025 email and IÕm happy to cooperate with Phase 1 (drying) on the
scheduled dates.

To keep the works moving without disrupting day-to-day living for me and my roommate (I
work nights and rest during the day), please conÞrm the following in writing:
¥ Accommodation: arranged and paid directly by the agency for the entire repair period (no
out-of-pocket and no reimbursement later). Near-CBD, quiet for daytime rest, with a desk
and internet.
¥ Work window (choose day-by-day; conÞrm ≥24h in advance)
¥ If accommodation is provided that day: full window 08:00Ð16:00 AEST. IÕll be o -site.
¥ If no accommodation that day: two short blocks 09:00Ð12:00 and 16:00Ð18:00 AEST;
during 12:00Ð16:00 there should be no entry and no noisy/heat-generating equipment in
the unit.
¥ Simple daily brief (non-technical): which areas to clear, whether I should be on/o -site
and for roughly how long, any doÕs/donÕts, when itÕs safe to re-use the space, and a single
on-site email contact.
¥ Utilities & cleanliness: agency covers additional power/water from the works; tidy daily;
restore condition on completion.
¥ Tenancy & rent: temporary relocation is not a surrender. On any day accommodation isnÕt
provided as agreed, or the bedroom remains unusable, daily rent abatement applies for
that day.
¥ Property damage: any damage/loss arising from the works is the agency/contractorÕs
responsibility; please conÞrm the remediation plan and timeframe in writing the same day
itÕs identiÞed.
¥ No Òno-accessÓ & comms: no Òno-accessÓ or similar charges unless ordered by the
Tribunal; email-only communication for records.

Please send the accommodation details (location/dates/terms), specify the daily time mode, and
the simple brief by 30 Aug 2025, 17:00 AEST. Once conÞrmed, IÕll prepare the space and
provide access as scheduled.

Hi Chawakorn & Podjana,
Good afternoon and hope you are well.
FIXD has scheduled the repair work and we have sent out the notice of entry accordingly Ð
please refer to the attached.
Repair works are required in the bedroom due to water ingress from the common property.
Highrise Strata has appointed FIXD Trade Group to carry out these works.
Phase 1 repairs Ð Drying process Ð are scheduled for:
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8 and 9 September 2025 (excluding Sunday, 7 September 2025).
This timeframe can vary, taking either less or more days depending on drying times. Once it
has been conÞrmed that the drying has been completed, Phase 2 (rectiÞcation) will then
begin. At that stage, FIXD will be able to provide an estimate of works once they have fully
assessed the damage.
Access will be needed from 8:00am on these dates, though the exact times may vary from day
to day depending on how the works are progressing, drying times, and other factors that
canÕt be predicted in advance. FIXD will keep you updated as the works move along and will
communicate with you about timings so youÕre aware.
We thank you in advance for your cooperation and will have these works completed as quickly
as possible.

Kind Regards,
Shaun Young
