Dear Hilary,

IÕm contacting you regarding an urgent issue in my unit (1803, 243 Franklin Street). This evening , I noticed a water leak forming on the wall above my bed. Within a single day, it spread rapidly Ñ now forming a long vertical swelling nearly from ceiling to ßoor.

I live on the top ßoor, so this may indicate a ceiling or roof issue. IÕm concerned it could worsen quickly if not addressed.

Please arrange for a maintenance inspection as soon as possible. IÕve attached photos for reference. Let me know if I need to do anything in the meantime.

Also, IÕd appreciate an update on the status of the bed repair I previously reported.

Thanks,
Chawakorn
