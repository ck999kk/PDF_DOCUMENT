Hi Chawakorn,
I just wanted to give you a quick update. The Strata's plumber attended to the hot water
leak last Wednesday and has addressed the issue. IÕll be confirming with the building
management shortly if thereÕs any further action needed.
Could you please let me know if you've noticed any further water ingress or any issues
since the plumber's visit?
Thanks for your help.
Best regards,

Sylvia Hao
