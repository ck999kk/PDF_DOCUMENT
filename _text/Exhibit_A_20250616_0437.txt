Dear Chawakorn,
I hope you're well, and thank you again for your continued engagement regarding the repair
matter.
Following instructions from the rental provider, we are now arranging to proceed with the required
repairs to the water-damaged wall and flooring. These works are necessary to prevent further
deterioration of the property.
To ensure works can commence without further delay, please expect a formal Notice of Entry to be
issued on Monday, 16 June 2025. This is in accordance with the Residential Tenancies Act and will
confirm the entry date and time for the Owners CorporationÕs contractors to attend.
As previously advised, the repair process is estimated to take approximately 7Ð12 days. If you
have any preferred times or specific availability for the week ahead, please feel free to share this
by 12:00 PM Monday, 16 June, and weÕll do our best to coordinate accordingly. However, please
note that access must be provided to prevent further damage and comply with maintenance
obligations.
In terms of rent compensation, a rent credit of $800 will be applied and reflected on your ledger.
This offer has been confirmed by the rental provider as final, with no further compensation to be
considered.
If you feel the current tenancy no longer suits your circumstances, the owner is open to discussing
a mutual lease termination, without penalty, should you wish to explore that option.
Please donÕt hesitate to reach out with any further questions or concerns Ñ we remain committed
to a timely and fair resolution.
Warm regards,

Sylvia Hao

Dear Sylvia,
IÕve taken some time to reflect on the communication surrounding this matter Ñ not just in
the past few days, but throughout the entire process.
