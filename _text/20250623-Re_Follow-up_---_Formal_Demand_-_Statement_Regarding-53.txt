Dear Johnson,

Thank you for your message. And honestly, I’m relieved to hear from someone new, because | don’t

feel that Sylvia Hao ever fully understood what I’ve been trying to say from the start.

Happy holiday to Sylvia — | hope she’s having a relaxing break. | wish | could take one too under the
current circumstances.

| kindly ask you to take a moment to review my past emails. At no point did | confirm that | agreed to
the works or gave consent to proceed. In fact, I’ve repeatedly asked Sylvia for proper information and
clarification, which | never received. The only thing | said was that | might be out of touch — which |
clearly explained was because | needed a break from all this due to how much stress it had caused
me. And now, after several days of silence, | suddenly receive a reminder that the works are
happening tomorrow?

| have no idea what’s going to happen to me tomorrow.

You’re asking me to provide access for something | was never truly consulted on. | was not given 14
days’ notice. And more importantly — where do you actually expect me to stay? | just paid $2,825 in
rent. | have no money for a second place. | can’t share a bedroom with my co-tenant. And no one
from your office, including Sylvia, has ever addressed that properly.

If this is the agency’s internal policy — to carry out major internal works while offering no
accommodation or practical alternatives to the tenant — then please confirm that to me clearly. It
would actually be helpful for me to have that confirmed, because | have now submitted this matter to
VCAT and am preparing to provide a complete record of what’s happened.

Again, | am not refusing access.

|am simply asking a question that no one has answered: where am |

supposed to stay?

Also, please do not attempt to contact me by phone. | will not answer any calls. All communication

must be in writing by email, as phone calls cannot be recorded or documented for evidence purposes.

Regards,

lof

Hi Chawakorn,

Thanks so much for checking in and for confirming.

We're currently following up with the Owners Corporation to lock in the repair schedule,
and we'll send through an update as soon as we hear back from their team.

If anything comes through today, I'll definitely pass it on.

Thanks again for your patience and understanding - we’re getting closer.

Warm regards,

Dear Chawakorn,

I hope you're well, and thank you again for your continued engagement regarding

the repair matter.

Following instructions from the rental provider, we are now arranging to proceed
with the required repairs to the water-damaged wall and flooring. These works
are necessary to prevent further deterioration of the property.

To ensure works can commence without further delay, please expect a formal
Notice of Entry to be issued on Monday, 16 June 2025. This is in accordance with

the Residential Tenancies Act and will confirm the entry date and time for the
Owners Corporation’s contractors to attend.

As previously advised, the repair process is estimated to take approximately 7-12
days. If you have any preferred times or specific availability for the week ahead,

Re: Follow-up — Formal Demand & Statement Regarding Unresolved Repairs (Unit 1803)

please feel free to share this by 12:00 PM Monday, 16 June, and we'll do our best
to coordinate accordingly. However, please note that access must be provided to
prevent further damage and comply with maintenance obligations.

In terms of rent compensation, a rent credit of $800 will be applied and reflected

on your ledger. This offer has been confirmed by the rental provider as final, with

no further compensation to be considered.

If you feel the current tenancy no longer suits your circumstances, the owner is
open to discussing a mutual lease termination, without penalty, should you wish
to explore that option.

Please don’t hesitate to reach out with any further questions or concerns — we
remain committed to a timely and fair resolution.

Warm regards,

Sylvia Hao

Dear Sylvia,
I’ve taken some time to reflect on the communication surrounding this
matter — not just in the past few days, but throughout the entire process.

The meeting times proposed in your recent email were sent without any
acknowledgement of my previous proposal, no explanation for the lack of
response to the 9:00 AM deadline I had clearly stated, and no apology for
the time and preparation that were disregarded when your office failed to
respond. That silence, in itself, said a great deal.
In addition, the questions I have raised — including the breakdown of the

$800 figure, the repair timeline, and the specific conditions affecting my
tenancy — have still not been addressed in writing. These are matters that

Re: Follow-up — Formal Demand & Statement Regarding Unresolved Repairs (Unit 1803)

should be readily available to your team, and I find it concerning that they
remain unanswered despite repeated and reasonable requests.

I’ve done my best to remain cooperative, flexible, and patient, even
though I am the one living with the ongoing impact. But based on the way
this has been handled, I no longer believe that an in-person meeting will
lead to any meaningful resolution — especially when my time and
concerns have not been respected.
Accordingly, I will not be attending any further meetings. From this point
forward, I will only continue this matter through formal written
communication. If that clarity is not provided, I will proceed with the
appropriate next steps without further notice.

I have made every effort to avoid escalation. If communication continues

in this pattern, the matter will simply follow its natural course.

Sincerely,

Chawakorn Kamnuansil

Thank you for your thoughtful response and for your continued openness
to resolving this matter collaboratively.

We understand the importance of your questions regarding the proposed
rent adjustment, repair timeline, and related concerns. Given the
complexity of the situation, we believe an in-person meeting would be
the most efficient and constructive way to go through all the details and
reach a clear understanding together.

We would like to invite you to our office at 33 Camberwell Road,

Hawthorn East, and offer the following options for a meeting on Friday,
13 June:

preferred time within that window).

You are welcome to bring your support person, and we'll ensure all

relevant documentation and responses are prepared in advance for
