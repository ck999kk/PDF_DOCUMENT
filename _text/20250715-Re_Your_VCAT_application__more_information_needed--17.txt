Dear VCAT Team,
I am writing to provide you with a copy of the VCAT application I lodged on 14 July 2025,
relating to the Notice to Vacate issued on 11 July 2025 for the property:
Unit 1803, 243 Franklin Street, Melbourne VIC 3000.
This application challenges the validity of the Notice to Vacate, on the basis that it constitutes
retaliatory eviction following legitimate maintenance complaints.
Attached to this email you will Þnd:

¥ A copy of the VCAT application form (Reference Number: R202518214/00)
¥ A copy of the Notice to Vacate
This email serves as formal service of the application as required under VCAT rules.
Please conÞrm receipt of this email.
If you have any questions, feel free to contact me by email or phone.
Kind regards,
Chawakorn Kamnuansil
