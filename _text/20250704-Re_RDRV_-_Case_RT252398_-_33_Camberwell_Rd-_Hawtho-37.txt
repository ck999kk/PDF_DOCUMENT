To Johnson,

This email is a formal response to the multiple, legally defective 'Notice to Renter'
documents issued by Areal Property. It outlines your non-compliance and contains a
Þnal demand for action.
Let us Þrst establish the facts, based entirely on your own actions and documentation:
1.
Your Notices Are Invalid: You deliberately marked "NO" on your own forms,
formally declaring no details were attached. This renders them defective under
the RTA.
2.
You Have Fabricated Evidence: You have repeatedly relied on a non-existent
"tenant-conÞrmation" to support your false narrative.

3.
Abdication of Professional Duty: Your notice directs me to seek help from
Consumer A airs Victoria. This is a formal admission of your failure to perform
your duties as an agent, attempting to outsource your responsibilities to me.

After 70+ days of this conduct, the direct result of your failures is that one simple,
fundamental question remains unanswered. The proposed work is in our only
bedroom. Sylvia's unprofessional suggestion to "stay at a friend's place" is not a
solution.
Therefore, a singular, fundamental question requires your immediate attention:

Where, precisely, are my roommate and I supposed to live while our bedroom is a
work site?
To be clear, any refusal of entry based on an unworkable or unreasonable planÑ
similar to the unhelpful suggestions you have provided in the pastÑwill not be
considered a breach on my part. The responsibility to provide a viable, respectful
solution rests entirely with you. Consider this carefully.
I require your clear, written plan for suitable temporary accommodation by 5:00 PM
tomorrow, 4 July 2025.
If you fail to provide this plan by the deadline, I will, without further notice, Þle an
urgent application with VCAT and a formal complaint with Consumer A airs Victoria.
The complaint will detail the entire pattern of conduct outlined in this email, including
your issuance of defective legal documents, fabrication of evidence, and abdication of
professional duties.
Your own documents will form the basis of my submissions.
