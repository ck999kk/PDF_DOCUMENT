Hi Charwakorn,

Just a quick update—OC contractor has confirmed that one of the affected rooms will

need to remain inaccessible during the drying process. Drying equipment will be placed
in that bedroom, and please note it does emit a moderate level of noise and
unfortunately cannot be switched off during operation.

If you prefer not to move out during this period, you're welcome to share the second
bedroom or use the living area as a temporary alternative. Could you please confirm if
access can be arranged for the drying equipment to be installed?

Let us know what works best for you, and we'll do our best to assist.

Best regards,

Sylvia Hao

I’ve followed up with the Owners Corporation to confirm that the leak has been

resolved, and I’ve requested that the necessary rectification works be arranged
without further delay. I’ve also asked them to provide a clear timeline for

inspection and repairs.

โ understand the inconvenience this has caused and appreciate your continued

patience. I'll keep you updated as soon as I receive a confirmed plan from their

side.

Best regards,

Hi Sylvia,

Thanks for your reply. Here’s an update on the wall — although the water has
dried, there is still a visible stain and surface warping, as shown in the attached

photo.

I’ve done my best to manage it temporarily using Gumption, but this is clearly
not a long-term solution and shouldn’t fall under the tenant’s responsibility.

The wall is still visibly damaged and the room remains unsuitable for normal use.
I need to know when someone will be sent to inspect and repair the affected
area. This needs to be addressed properly, not just acknowledged.

Also, for record-keeping purposes, all communication regarding this matter must
be done via email, as phone calls cannot be documented as evidence if needed.

I expect a response with a clear action plan and timeline.

Best regards,

Chawakorn

Hi Chawakorn,

Thank you for your email, and | do apologise for the lack of updates — | understand
your concerns and appreciate your continued patience.

The plumber who attended the unit last Wednesday was arranged by the Owner’s
Corporation to address the leak from the hot water system. We are currently waiting

on their formal report to confirm that the issue has been fully resolved.

In the meantime, could you please let me know if there has been any further water
ingress or signs of dampness since their visit? This will help ensure there are no
Ongoing issues.

Once we receive confirmation that the source of the leak is no longer active, we will

arrange for quotations to repair the internal damage, including the wall and
potentially affected carpet and underlay.

| understand how frustrating this situation is and will continue to follow up with the

relevant parties to ensure the matter is addressed appropriately.

Kind Regards,

Hi Sylvia,

It’s been over a week since the plumber attended, and I’ve yet to see any

30/8/68, 16:51

Re: FW: Follow-up on Wall and Carpet Damage — 1803/243 Franklin St

update or progress on the condition of my unit. I had already sent photos
clearly showing wall damage — fixing the leak alone doesn’t resolve everything.

This unit is carpeted, and the leak went on for days. It’s only logical to assume
the carpet and underlay have been affected too. Does it really make sense to
think the issue ends with the hot water pipe?

Also, why has there been complete silence? It’s not even during a public holiday

period this time, and yet I’m still left waiting with no information. Is the delay
coming from the building manager, or is the owner just not interested in
maintaining their own property?

I’ve been patient long enough. Please advise what steps are being taken
regarding both the wall and the carpet, and whether an inspection will be
arranged.

Regards,

Chawakorn
