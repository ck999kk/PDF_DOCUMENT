How to send and access evidence in a residential tenancy case | VCAT
Estimated time to VCAT
We prioritise cases that the renting laws say must be heard within a certain time, and those we
consider urgent. For example, urgent repairs are heard within 2 business days, and applications
involving personal or family violence are heard within 3 business days. It takes about 7 business
days to hear cases about non-urgent repairs. Applications for possession due to danger, damage,
or disruption are scheduled for hearing as soon as possible within 4-6 weeks. Possession
applications due to unpaid rent are heard in about 6 weeks, and most other applications for
possession and renewals are heard within 8-10 weeks.
For applications considered urgent under the law, we contact you by text, phone or email
within 24-48 hours. At an urgent hearing, only the urgent issues will be dealt with. Non-urgent
issues, such as compensation, will be dealt with when there is more time at a later hearing.
Applications for re-opening (request for a review)
If you have submitted a review of an order that allows the Residential Rental Provider (Landlord) to
purchase a Warrant of Possession, VCAT will not issue the Warrant until the review hearing is
heard.
If the Warrant has been issued before the review request was made, VCAT will make an order
placing the Warrant on hold until the review hearing is heard. If the Warrant is being executed
within 48 hours, you must contact our customer service team on 1300 01 8228 (1300 01 VCAT)
and alert us to your request.
If the Warrant is executed before an order is made placing the Warrant on hold, this cannot be
reversed.
A copy of this order is sent to all parties and the Police identiÞed on the Warrant.
If you or the Police have not received a copy of this order, please contact our customer service
team on 1300 01 8228 (1300 01 VCAT)
