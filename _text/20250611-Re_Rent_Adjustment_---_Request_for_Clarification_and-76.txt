Dear Sylvia,

Thank you again for your recent update, and for forwarding the proposed rent adjustment of $800.

As IÕve mentioned previously, IÕm still very open to resolving this matter directly and as fairly as
possible, given the nature and duration of the disruption.

Before I can respond to the proposed amount, IÕd really appreciate your clariÞcation on a few key
points, just so thereÕs no confusion going forward:
¥ How exactly was the $800 Þgure calculated?
¥ What time period does it cover?
¥ Does it reßect one tenant or both of us?
¥ If accepted, would that payment mean I canÕt raise other issues like earlier disruption or
temporary accommodation?
¥ And whatÕs the current expected repair timeline?

From my side, IÕve been looking at the impact from around 15 April, which is when the issue
started and when I Þrst reached out. So I hope that context can be considered as part of your
teamÕs preparation before we meet. It would really help if everything could be brought or explained
clearly during the discussion, so we donÕt go in circles.

To keep things moving forward, IÕd like to propose an in-person meeting at your o ce on
Thursday, 12 June at 10:30 AM. IÕll be bringing a support person with me as well. Nothing formal
Ñ just someone to help me navigate things clearly.

If this time doesnÕt work for your team, please let me know by 9:00 AM Thursday. If I donÕt hear
back by then, IÕll assume the meeting canÕt go ahead as suggested and will take the next steps
from there.

Thank you again Ñ IÕm still hopeful we can bring this to a clear and fair resolution.

Temporary Relocation:
As discussed, the affected bedroom will need to be vacant during the repair work,
including the installation of drying equipment.
Co-Tenant Impact:
We recognize that your co-tenant will also be affected by these repairs. Please
rest assured that we will keep both of you informed about the repair schedule and
any potential disruptions.
We fully respect your decision to withhold consent until these matters are fully
addressed in writing. We are working to resolve this as quickly as possible and will
provide all the necessary details as soon as they are available.
If you have any further questions or need additional clarification, please donÕt
hesitate to reach out.
Kind regards,

Sylvia Hao

Dear Sylvia,
Thank you for your response dated Friday, 6 June 2025 at 11:50am.
As the primary resident of the property who has lived through weeks of
unresolved water damage, I must reiterate that no one is more eager than I am
to see the situation resolved quickly and properly. However, I am currently
unable to provide consent for any repair work to begin.
Firstly, your email referred to repairs commencing on "Thursday, 6 June"a date
which had already passed at the time of your message. This inconsistency is not
just confusing; it is logistically impossible and calls into question the seriousness
of the repair planning. Such unclear and last-minute communication cannot form

30/8/68, 16:50

the basis for valid consent.
Secondly, I must emphasise that I cannot authorise access until the following
points are clearly confirmed in writing:
1. A definitive and specific repair timeline, including projected completion date.
2. Whether temporary relocation will be required, and if so, what arrangements
or compensation are being offered.
3. Your position on my formal request for rent reduction and confirmation of nonliability, which remain outstanding.
4. Acknowledgment of the impact on my co-tenant, who is also named in the
lease agreement, and who will equally be affected by noise and accessibility
issues related to the drying equipment.
It is my responsibility to ensure that any agreement made does not inadvertently
waive our legal rights or create further hardship. I must act cautiously, especially
as the installation of industrial drying equipment operating 24/7 poses real
disturbancessomething your office acknowledged in our previous phone call.
If I were to consent now without these matters resolved in writing, it could later
be used to suggest that I accepted all resulting conditions, which I absolutely do
not.
Therefore, I will only provide access once I receive formal written confirmation
addressing all points above. Until then, I consider it unreasonable to demand a
commitment from me, especially under these unclear and one-sided
circumstances.
As noted in my formal demand, if a resolution is not reached within five (5)
calendar daysincluding weekendsI will proceed to file an application with VCAT.
Kind regards,
Chawakorn Kamnuansil

Dear Chawakorn,
Thank you for your email and the supporting documents outlining your
concerns and formal request.
We understand the impact this situation has had on your tenancy and
appreciate the way youÕve approached the matter. We will now forward
your request and documentation to the Owners Corporation for
consideration of a rent compensation claim based on the current
circumstances.
In the meantime, we are aiming to proceed with the repair works as soon
as possible. Could you kindly confirm whether works can commence on
Thursday, 6 June 2025, or let us know your earliest availability to provide
access?
We will continue to keep you updated as we receive further information
from the Owners Corporation.
Kind regards,

Sylvia Hao

Dear Sylvia,

I am writing with the intent of resolving this matter constructively and

without escalation, if possible.

Over the past two months, I have reported the water damage issue
multiple times in good faith, cooperated with your office, and done my
best to remain in the property despite the difficulties. I am not trying to
be confrontational; I simply need a clear and reasonable outcome,
supported by appropriate action and communication.

Please find attached:

1.
A formal demand letter outlining my request for rent compensation, a
firm repair timeline, and confirmation of non-liability Ð based on my
rights under the Residential Tenancies Act 1997 (VIC).
2.
A supporting tenant statement summarising the verbal communication
with your office around 2Ð3 June 2025, including the temporary
accommodation proposal and its impractical conditions.

If a fair and written resolution is not reached within five (5) business
days, I will have no choice but to initiate proceedings through VCAT. I
sincerely hope this can be avoided and that we can achieve a reasonable
solution for all parties involved.

I would appreciate your written response at your earliest convenience.

Kind regards,
