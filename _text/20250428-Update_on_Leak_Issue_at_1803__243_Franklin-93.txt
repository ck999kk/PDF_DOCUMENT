Hi Chawakorn,
Just a quick update Ñ the OC sent plumber inspected the roof this morning and
confirmed that the main issue is a leak from the hot water system. TheyÕve
recommended getting a plumber out as soon as possible to fix it.
Once the repair is done, another inspection may be needed to ensure no damage to the
membrane around the area.
We will request OC to reinstate the walls once leaking fixed.
Thanks for your patience, and IÕll keep you posted on the progress.
Kind regards,

Sylvia Hao
