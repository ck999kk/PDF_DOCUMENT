Dear Johnson,
Thank you for your follow-up regarding events. I sincerely apologize for any inconvenience caused.
I want to clarify that I have never refused access for necessary repairs. The situation on 24 June occurred due to
inadequate advance communication about the speciÞc scheduling and requirements, which left me unprepared
for the visit.
I genuinely regret that the contractor's time was a ected, and I understand this may have caused complications
for the scheduling process.
As this matter is now being handled through the formal dispute resolution process (Case RT252398), I believe
all repair coordination should proceed through the o cial RDRV channel to ensure proper documentation and
clarity for all parties moving forward.
I remain committed to resolving this matter constructively and cooperatively, and I look forward to working with
the Resolution Coordinator to establish an appropriate process that works for everyone involved.
Thank you for your understanding, and I apologize again for yesterday's circumstances.
Regards,
Chawakorn Kamnuansil

Hi Chawakon,
I hope you're both safe and well.
IÕve just been informed by the contractor arranged by the Owners Corporation that they were unable
to carry out the scheduled repair work this morning due to an access issue. They mentioned they
rang both the intercom and your mobile but unfortunately couldnÕt get through.
After waiting for approximately an hour, they had no choice but to leave the building. As a result,
they will need to charge the OC for the call-out and arrange a new time for the job to be completed.
Our primary concern is to ensure everything is okay on your end, especially as we havenÕt heard
from you today.
Please let us know that you're safe when you get a moment, and weÕll work with the OC to
coordinate a new appointment as soon as possible.

Hi Chawakorn,
Thank you for your reply. I want to start by sincerely apologising for the inconvenience and
frustration this ongoing issue has caused you. I truly understand how disruptive this must be, and I
appreciate your continued patience throughout.
After reviewing the communication trail, I want to clarify that the source of the leak originates from
a common area of the building, which falls under the Owners Corporation's (OC) responsibility. As a
result, all scheduling and repair works need to be coordinated through them. Unfortunately, this has
contributed to the delays, and I understand how frustrating that can be.
To address your first question: Sylvia did send an email on 18 June 2025 to both you and Podjana
once the OC confirmed the appointment details. IÕve attached a screenshot of that email for your
reference. ItÕs possible it was missed, but IÕm glad to hear that youÕll be able to provide access
tomorrow.
Regarding alternative accommodation, it was my understanding that the agreed $800 compensation
was intended to help offset those costs. If IÕve misunderstood or missed anything, please do let me
knowÑthereÕs been a lot of emails, and I want to ensure nothing important is overlooked. The
amount will be set as rent credit once the repair is commenced.
Again, I truly empathise with your situation. From what IÕve seen, Sylvia has been doing her utmost
to keep communication flowing between all parties involvedÑyourself, the rental provider, the OC,
and their plumber. Unfortunately, her ability to act is limited when the responsible party is not as
responsive as we would hope.
Please rest assured that we will continue to follow up closely and advocate for this to be resolved as
quickly as possible.

Dear Johnson,

Thank you for your message. And honestly, IÕm relieved to hear from someone new, because I
donÕt feel that Sylvia Hao ever fully understood what IÕve been trying to say from the start.

Happy holiday to Sylvia Ñ I hope sheÕs having a relaxing break. I wish I could take one too under
the current circumstances.

I kindly ask you to take a moment to review my past emails. At no point did I confirm that I agreed
to the works or gave consent to proceed. In fact, IÕve repeatedly asked Sylvia for proper
information and clarification, which I never received. The only thing I said was that I might be out
of touch Ñ which I clearly explained was because I needed a break from all this due to how much
stress it had caused me. And now, after several days of silence, I suddenly receive a reminder that
the works are happening tomorrow?

I have no idea whatÕs going to happen to me tomorrow.

YouÕre asking me to provide access for something I was never truly consulted on. I was not given
14 daysÕ notice. And more importantly Ñ where do you actually expect me to stay? I just paid
$2,825 in rent. I have no money for a second place. I canÕt share a bedroom with my co-tenant.
And no one from your office, including Sylvia, has ever addressed that properly.

If this is the agencyÕs internal policy Ñ to carry out major internal works while offering no
accommodation or practical alternatives to the tenant Ñ then please confirm that to me clearly. It
would actually be helpful for me to have that confirmed, because I have now submitted this matter
to VCAT and am preparing to provide a complete record of whatÕs happened.

Again, I am not refusing access. I am simply asking a question that no one has answered: where
am I supposed to stay?

Also, please do not attempt to contact me by phone. I will not answer any calls. All communication
must be in writing by email, as phone calls cannot be recorded or documented for evidence
purposes.

Regards,

Dear Chawakorn,
I hope you're well, and thank you again for your continued engagement regarding
the repair matter.
Following instructions from the rental provider, we are now arranging to proceed
with the required repairs to the water-damaged wall and flooring. These works
are necessary to prevent further deterioration of the property.
To ensure works can commence without further delay, please expect a formal
Notice of Entry to be issued on Monday, 16 June 2025. This is in accordance with
the Residential Tenancies Act and will confirm the entry date and time for the
Owners CorporationÕs contractors to attend.
As previously advised, the repair process is estimated to take approximately 7Ð12
days. If you have any preferred times or specific availability for the week ahead,
please feel free to share this by 12:00 PM Monday, 16 June, and weÕll do our best
to coordinate accordingly. However, please note that access must be provided to
prevent further damage and comply with maintenance obligations.
In terms of rent compensation, a rent credit of $800 will be applied and reflected
on your ledger. This offer has been confirmed by the rental provider as final, with
no further compensation to be considered.

Re: Follow-up Ð Formal Demand & Statement Regarding Unresolved Repairs (Unit 1803)

If you feel the current tenancy no longer suits your circumstances, the owner is
open to discussing a mutual lease termination, without penalty, should you wish
to explore that option.
Please donÕt hesitate to reach out with any further questions or concerns Ñ we
remain committed to a timely and fair resolution.
Warm regards,

Sylvia Hao

Dear Sylvia,
IÕve taken some time to reflect on the communication surrounding this
matter Ñ not just in the past few days, but throughout the entire process.

The meeting times proposed in your recent email were sent without any
acknowledgement of my previous proposal, no explanation for the lack of
response to the 9:00 AM deadline I had clearly stated, and no apology for
the time and preparation that were disregarded when your office failed to
respond. That silence, in itself, said a great deal.
In addition, the questions I have raised Ñ including the breakdown of the
$800 figure, the repair timeline, and the specific conditions affecting my
tenancy Ñ have still not been addressed in writing. These are matters that
should be readily available to your team, and I find it concerning that they
remain unanswered despite repeated and reasonable requests.
IÕve done my best to remain cooperative, flexible, and patient, even
though I am the one living with the ongoing impact. But based on the way
this has been handled, I no longer believe that an in-person meeting will
lead to any meaningful resolution Ñ especially when my time and
concerns have not been respected.
Accordingly, I will not be attending any further meetings. From this point
forward, I will only continue this matter through formal written
communication. If that clarity is not provided, I will proceed with the

appropriate next steps without further notice.
I have made every effort to avoid escalation. If communication continues
in this pattern, the matter will simply follow its natural course.

Sincerely,

Chawakorn Kamnuansil
