Dear Matthew,
Thank you for your email regarding Case RT252398 at 33 Camberwell Rd, Hawthorn East.
I just want to share some information from my side to help you understand the situation more
clearly. I'm an international student living in this unit, and IÕm not very familiar with all the
repair or legal processes in Melbourne, but IÕm really trying to follow everything the right way.
Recently I heard that a contractor came, but I didnÕt receive any clear message or schedule
about what was going to happen. I didnÕt know if they were coming just to check or to actually
repair the problem. I also wasnÕt told if I needed to leave the room or prepare anything. Because
I live in the area that needs repair, this kind of information is really important for me to get
ready properly.
To try my best, I stayed up the whole night before working on documents and preparing
everything I thought might be useful for this case. I Þnished around 5 AM. I was trying to be
responsible and respectful of the process. Unfortunately, I was so tired that I accidentally fell
asleep in the morning and didnÕt hear anything when the contractor came. It wasnÕt on purpose,
and I really didnÕt mean to miss them.
I never refused access. I just didnÕt get clear communication about the visit and couldnÕt
prepare for it properly. I still really want the repair to be done and IÕm happy to reschedule, as
long as I know in advance what will happen and what I need to do.
Please continue with the case. The problem hasnÕt been Þxed yet and IÕm hoping we can move
forward.
Kind regards,
Chawakorn Kamnuansil
