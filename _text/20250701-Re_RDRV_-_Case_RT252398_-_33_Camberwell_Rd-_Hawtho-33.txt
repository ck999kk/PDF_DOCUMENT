Hi Chawakorn & Matthew,

Good afternoon and hope you all are well.
Quick update, we have served 3 x notice of entry today via registered post (please refer to the
Þles attached).
FIXD will need access to the property at 8AM on 7 July 2025, and for the rest of the week as
mentioned in the notice.

This will be the Þrst stage of remediation work, which is to treat the mould and bring the
moisture level down.
They might not need to be in the property for the entire 9 hours in the Þrst few days, but they
will need access to check the moisture level in daily basis.
Please be advised that if FIXD is unable to commence the work due to deny of access, the
minimum labour charge applies and the cost will be forwarded to you.

Please let us know if you have any questions about this. Thank you.

Kind Regards,

Hi Matthew & Chawakorn,

Good morning and hope you are well.
I have received the reply from FIXD Trade Group Ð contractor appointed by the OC for the
repair.
I have asked for the project timeline, and below is the reply:

Please see below extract from our scope of works sent to Highrise Strata.
The drying process is essential for ensuring all a ected building materials return to pre-loss
moisture levels. However, the length of drying time may vary depending on external factors
such as weather conditions and moisture content. FIXD is not responsible for delays in drying
due to uncontrollable factors. Monitoring will be conducted daily, and any necessary
adjustments/cost variations will be communicated promptly. FIXD will not be held responsible
for any pre-existing conditions discovered during the course of remediation, including but
not limited to structural defects, non-compliant installations, or prior water damage. Any
discoveries will be communicated to the insured, and additional works may be required
outside the scope of this project.
We cannot provide a timeline as per your request due to the existing site constraints and
nature of the damages.
Please note, once drying equipment is on-site, it is charged per day. If access is not provided
as required by our team, extra charges may be applicable to the renters for not providing

access.
Hi Chawakorn,
Since no access was given on 24 June 2025, the contractor has sent us the attached invoice.
Please advise whether you would like to pay them directly.
Otherwise, the OC will settle with FIXD and on-charge the amount to Lot 1803A, and the
rental provider will be seeking reimbursement from you.
Please advise, thank you.

Hi Matthew,

Thank you for your call earlier.
I have conÞrmed with the contractor from FIXD Trade Group, the work is now scheduled for 7
July 2025.
This is the exact same job scope, which was scheduled for 24 June 2025, but no access was
granted that day.

The work consists of few stages, and the trade will not be able to send me the timeline until
he is back to the o ce tomorrow.
On 7 July 2025, the work will be mould remediation, which is to bring the moisture level in
the a ected bedroom down.
Once the moisture level is at the appropriate level, the damage rectiÞcation job will be
commenced (wall repair & etc).
FIXD Trade Group will need multiple entries for the entire repair work.

Once I have received the timeline from them, I will forward it across so that we are all on the
same page.

Dear Matthew,
I just received your email about closing my case and I'm quite confused. I thought getting a
repair date was just the beginning of solving my problems, not the end.
**The key issues I still need help with are:**
- Compensation for 70+ days of paying full rent for an unusable bedroom
- Where to stay during repairs (the agency hasn't provided any solution for this yet)
- This has now a ected my studies - my college contacted me this week about urgent matters
**I don't understand - does getting a repair date mean I can't ask about these other problems
anymore?**
Thank you so much for arranging the July 7th repair after you contacted them. It's amazing
they could suddenly arrange it after saying they needed 6-7 business days when I was asking,
and I'd already waited over two months.
I also wanted to mention that I haven't been able to conÞrm access for the repairs yet because
the agency hasn't answered any of my previous questions about what exactly will happen
during the repairs or what solutions they'll provide. From what I understand, my ßatmate and
I will need to leave our rooms during the work, which is quite a big decision that a ects both
our daily lives directly. I don't think it makes sense for me to conÞrm anything when I haven't
received any information about the details or arrangements.
I'm very sorry if I'm completely misunderstanding how this process works. As an international
student who has never dealt with anything like this before, I realize I probably don't
understand what VCAT can and cannot help with. I was hoping you might be able to guide me
about what's reasonable to expect, but I understand if I'm asking for things that aren't part of
your role.
Should I just accept whatever happens with the repairs and forget about the past 70+ days
and other problems? I don't want to cause trouble, but it doesn't feel right to just forget
everything that happened.

Re: RDRV - Case RT252398 - 33 Camberwell Rd, Hawthorn East, VIC, 3123

I'm quite overwhelmed and honestly don't know what to do about the compensation and
accommodation issues. Could you please help me understand if there are options to address
these concerns even if the repairs get scheduled?
I hope it's okay to communicate in writing as phone conversations are di cult for me with
serious matters. I don't have friends or family here who understand these problems, so I'm
trying to Þgure everything out alone.
Thank you for your patience with me.
Thank you,

Hi Matthew,
Thank you for your email.
I have spoken with them yesterday morning and they have advised that due to their tight
schedule, they will have to look into their booking and let us know when is the next
available date.
The contractor advised that the next available date should be within the next 6-7 business
days.
Since I havenÕt received any conÞrmation, I have just sent another email to the OC and the
contractor, asking them to provide a date & time.
I will let you know once I have heard back from them.

Good afternoon Johnson

Can you please conÞrm whether you are able to conÞrm a time that trades will be able to
reattend the property. Could you please conÞrm this by close of business today.

If not I will need to progress this matter to a hearing due to timeframes required to list
urgent repair applications.

If an agreement can be reached regarding a timeframe to resolve the repair issue this
matter can be struck out with a right of reinstatement. I have included the renters in this
