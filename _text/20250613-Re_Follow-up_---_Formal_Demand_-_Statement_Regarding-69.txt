Dear Sylvia,

I've taken some time to reflect on the communication surrounding this matter — not just in the past few days,
but throughout the entire process.
The meeting times proposed in your recent email were sent without any acknowledgement of my previous
proposal, no explanation for the lack of response to the 9:00 AM deadline | had clearly stated, and no apology
for the time and preparation that were disregarded when your office failed to respond. That silence, in itself,
said a great deal.

In addition, the questions | have raised — including the breakdown of the $800 figure, the repair timeline, and
the specific conditions affecting my tenancy — have still not been addressed in writing. These are matters
that should be readily available to your team, and | find it concerning that they remain unanswered despite
repeated and reasonable requests.

I've done my best to remain cooperative, flexible, and patient, even though | am the one living with the
ongoing impact. But based on the way this has been handled, | no longer believe that an in-person meeting will
lead to any meaningful resolution — especially when my time and concerns have not been respected.
Accordingly, | will not be attending any further meetings. From this point forward, | will only continue this
matter through formal written communication. If that clarity is not provided, | will proceed with the appropriate

next steps without further notice.
| have made every effort to avoid escalation. If communication continues in this pattern, the matter will simply
follow its natural course.

Sincerely,
Chawakorn Kamnuansil

Dear Sylvia,

Thank you again for your recent update, and for forwarding the proposed rent adjustment of

$800.

As I’ve mentioned previously, I’m still very open to resolving this matter directly and as fairly as
possible, given the nature and duration of the disruption.

Before I can respond to the proposed amount, I'd really appreciate your clarification on a few
key points, just so there’s no confusion going forward:

How exactly was the $800 figure calculated?

30/8/68. 16:50

Re: Follow-up — Formal Demand & Statement Regarding Unresolved Repairs (Unit 1803)

What time period does it cover?

Does it reflect one tenant or both of us?

If accepted, would that payment mean I can’t raise other issues like earlier disruption or
temporary accommodation?

And what’s the current expected repair timeline?

From my side, I’ve been looking at the impact from around 15 April, which is when the issue

started and when I first reached out. So I hope that context can be considered as part of your
team’s preparation before we meet. It would really help if everything could be brought or
explained clearly during the discussion, so we don’t go in circles.

To keep things moving forward, I’d like to propose an in-person meeting at your office on
Thursday, 12 June at 10:30 AM. I'll be bringing a support person with me as well. Nothing
formal — just someone to help me navigate things clearly.

If this time doesn’t work for your team, please let me know by 9:00 AM Thursday. If I don’t hear
back by then, I'll assume the meeting can’t go ahead as suggested and will take the next steps
from there.

Thank you again — I’m still hopeful we can bring this to a clear and fair resolution.

Kind regards,

Chawakorn Kamnuansil

Dear Chawakorn,

I've received confirmation from the Owners Corporation that they are happy to proceed
with the previously proposed rent reduction of $800.00.

Could you kindly confirm if you’re happy with this adjustment?

Dear Chawakorn,

Thank you for your email and for clearly outlining your concerns. We completely

understand the frustration and inconvenience this ongoing issue has caused, and
we truly appreciate your patience.

Repair Timeline:
We have formally submitted your 30% rent reduction request to the Owners
Corporation and are awaiting their response. Once we receive their feedback, we
will provide you with a confirmed repair timeline and projected completion date.

Temporary Relocation:

As discussed, the affected bedroom will need to be vacant during the repair work,
including the installation of drying equipment.

Co-Tenant Impact:
We recognize that your co-tenant will also be affected by these repairs. Please

rest assured that we will keep both of you informed about the repair schedule and
any potential disruptions.

We fully respect your decision to withhold consent until these matters are fully

addressed in writing. We are working to resolve this as quickly as possible and
will provide all the necessary details as soon as they are available.

If you have any further questions or need additional clarification, please don’t
hesitate to reach out.

Dear Sylvia,

Thank you for your response dated Friday, 6 June 2025 at 11:50am.

As the primary resident of the property who has lived through weeks of
unresolved water damage, I must reiterate that no one is more eager than I am

to see the situation resolved quickly and properly. However, I am currently
unable to provide consent for any repair work to begin.

Firstly, your email referred to repairs commencing on "Thursday, 6 June"a date
which had already passed at the time of your message. This inconsistency is not

just confusing; it is logistically impossible and calls into question the seriousness
of the repair planning. Such unclear and last-minute communication cannot form
the basis for valid consent.

Secondly, I must emphasise that I cannot authorise access until the following
points are clearly confirmed in writing:

1. A definitive and specific repair timeline, including projected completion date.
2. Whether temporary relocation will be required, and if so, what arrangements
or compensation are being offered.
3. Your position on my formal request for rent reduction and confirmation of nonliability, which remain outstanding.
4. Acknowledgment of the impact on my co-tenant, who is also named in the

lease agreement, and who will equally be affected by noise and accessibility
issues related to the drying equipment.

It is my responsibility to ensure that any agreement made does not inadvertently

waive our legal rights or create further hardship. I must act cautiously, especially

as the installation of industrial drying equipment operating 24/7 poses real
disturbancessomething your office acknowledged in our previous phone call.

30/8/68, 16:50

Re: Follow-up — Formal Demand & Statement Regarding Unresolved Repairs (Unit 1803)

If I were to consent now without these matters resolved in writing, it could later

be used to suggest that I accepted all resulting conditions, which I absolutely do
not.

Therefore, I will only provide access once I receive formal written confirmation

addressing all points above. Until then, I consider it unreasonable to demand a
commitment from me, especially under these unclear and one-sided
circumstances.

As noted in my formal demand, if a resolution is not reached within five (5)
calendar daysincluding weekendsI will proceed to file an application with VCAT.

Kind regards,

Chawakorn Kamnuansil

Dear Chawakorn,

Thank you for your email and the supporting documents outlining your
concerns and formal request.

We understand the impact this situation has had on your tenancy and
appreciate the way you've approached the matter. We will now forward
your request and documentation to the Owners Corporation for
consideration of a rent compensation claim based on the current
circumstances.

In the meantime, we are aiming to proceed with the repair works as soon
as possible. Could you kindly confirm whether works can commence on

Thursday, 6 June 2025, or let us know your earliest availability to provide
access?

We will continue to keep you updated as we receive further information
from the Owners Corporation.

Kind regards,

Sylvia Hao

Dear Sylvia,

I am writing with the intent of resolving this matter constructively and
without escalation, if possible.

Over the past two months, I have reported the water damage issue
multiple times in good faith, cooperated with your office, and done my
best to remain in the property despite the difficulties. I am not trying to
be confrontational; I simply need a clear and reasonable outcome,
supported by appropriate action and communication.

Please find attached:

1.

A formal demand letter outlining my request for rent compensation, a
firm repair timeline, and confirmation of non-liability - based on my
rights under the Residential Tenancies Act 1997 (VIC).
2.

A supporting tenant statement summarising the verbal communication
with your office around 2-3 June 2025, including the temporary

accommodation proposal and its impractical conditions.

If a fair and written resolution is not reached within five (5) business
days, I will have no choice but to initiate proceedings through VCAT. I

sincerely hope this can be avoided and that we can achieve a reasonable
