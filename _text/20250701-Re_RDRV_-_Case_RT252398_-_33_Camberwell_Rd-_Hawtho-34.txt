Hi Matthew,
We would like to bring to your attention that over the past few weeks, we have made every
reasonable e ort to coordinate with the Owners Corporation (OC) and the appointed contractor,
FIXD, to facilitate essential repair works at the property. This is now our second attempt to
proceed with the repairs. To clarify, all relevant parties Ð including the OC, FIXD, our agency as the
managing agent, and the rental provider are fully committed to commencing and completing the
necessary repairs as promptly as possible.
We are more than willing to provide any further information the renter may reasonably request to
facilitate cooperation. However, we respectfully request that VCAT take into account that we are
NOT the party impeding progress.
Hi Chawakorn,
Please refer to below response in blue, as I have communicated with FIXD prior to this email.
I will get the remaining requested details from FIXD, but I canÕt guarantee that they will reply
within 24 hours.
Given that coordinating this repair requires the involvement of multiple parties and signiÞcant
resources, your cooperation is not only appreciated but essential to ensure the work can proceed
without further delay.
Thank you.

Kind Regards,
Johnson Tan

Dear Johnson,
Your three Section-86 notices, lodged by registered post on 27 June 2025, seek entry at
08:00 AM on 7, 8 and 9 JulyÑonly **12 daysÕ** lead timeÑand leave the ÒDetails attachedÓ box
unchecked. Entry therefore remains conditional.
SEND WITHIN 24 HOURS
1. Contractor legal name, licence number & 24-hour mobile Ð Pending FIXDÕs reply
2. Day-by-day work scope (rooms, tasks, time estimates) for the full 7-day schedule The Þrst
stage of the repair involves reducing the moisture levels in the a ected bedroom, as outlined in
the Notice of Entry. During this drying process, the contractor will require daily access to the room
in order to monitor and record moisture readings. At this stage, they are unable to provide
speciÞc time estimates for this phase, as the duration will depend on how quickly acceptable
moisture levels are reached. Once the area has dried su ciently, they will proceed with the
necessary repair work. Please note that because the contractor has not yet assessed the current
site conditions in full, they are unable to provide a deÞnitive timeline or scope for the repairs at
this time.
3. Risk statement Ð water / power interruptions & noise levels - Pending FIXDÕs reply
4. Public-liability / PI insurance certiÞcate - Pending FIXDÕs reply
5. ÒTax invoice.pdfÓ **and** the alleged Òtenant-conÞrmationÓ screenshot FIXD has been
engaged by the Owners Corporation, as the source of the leak originates from a common area.
The OC will cover the cost of the repairs once the work is completed. At this stage, FIXD is unable
to provide a quote, as they have not yet been able to assess the current site conditions in detail.
Could you please clarify what you mean by a Òtenant-conÞrmation screenshotÓ?
6. Daily-rate schedule for drying equipment **plus** written assurance that no
Òno-accessÓ surcharge will be levied without a Tribunal order As previously mentioned, FIXD is
the contractor appointed by the Owners Corporation (OC), and the OC will be covering the cost of
the scheduled works. Could you please clarify the relevance of the Òdaily-rate schedule for drying
equipmentÓ? There will be no additional charges incurred, provided FIXD is granted access in
accordance with the Notice of Entry and there are no delays caused by restricted access or
obstruction to the repair process.

Hi Chawakorn & Matthew,
Good afternoon and hope you all are well.
Quick update, we have served 3 x notice of entry today via registered post (please refer to the
Þles attached).
FIXD will need access to the property at 8AM on 7 July 2025, and for the rest of the week as
mentioned in the notice.
This will be the Þrst stage of remediation work, which is to treat the mould and bring the
moisture level down.
They might not need to be in the property for the entire 9 hours in the Þrst few days, but they
will need access to check the moisture level in daily basis.
Please be advised that if FIXD is unable to commence the work due to deny of access, the
minimum labour charge applies and the cost will be forwarded to you.
Please let us know if you have any questions about this. Thank you.

Hi Matthew & Chawakorn,
Good morning and hope you are well.
I have received the reply from FIXD Trade Group Ð contractor appointed by the OC for the repair.
I have asked for the project timeline, and below is the reply:

Please see below extract from our scope of works sent to Highrise Strata.
The drying process is essential for ensuring all a ected building materials return to pre-loss
moisture levels. However, the length of drying time may vary depending on external factors
such as weather conditions and moisture content. FIXD is not responsible for delays in drying
due to uncontrollable factors. Monitoring will be conducted daily, and any necessary
adjustments/cost variations will be communicated promptly. FIXD will not be held responsible
for any pre-existing conditions discovered during the course of remediation, including but not
limited to structural defects, non-compliant installations, or prior water damage. Any
discoveries will be communicated to the insured, and additional works may be required outside
the scope of this project.
We cannot provide a timeline as per your request due to the existing site constraints and nature

of the damages.
Please note, once drying equipment is on-site, it is charged per day. If access is not provided as
required by our team, extra charges may be applicable to the renters for not providing access.
Hi Chawakorn,
Since no access was given on 24 June 2025, the contractor has sent us the attached invoice.
Please advise whether you would like to pay them directly.
Otherwise, the OC will settle with FIXD and on-charge the amount to Lot 1803A, and the rental
provider will be seeking reimbursement from you.
Please advise, thank you.

Hi Matthew,
Thank you for your call earlier.
I have conÞrmed with the contractor from FIXD Trade Group, the work is now scheduled for 7
July 2025.
This is the exact same job scope, which was scheduled for 24 June 2025, but no access was
granted that day.
The work consists of few stages, and the trade will not be able to send me the timeline until he
is back to the o ce tomorrow.
On 7 July 2025, the work will be mould remediation, which is to bring the moisture level in the
a ected bedroom down.
Once the moisture level is at the appropriate level, the damage rectiÞcation job will be
commenced (wall repair & etc).
FIXD Trade Group will need multiple entries for the entire repair work.
Once I have received the timeline from them, I will forward it across so that we are all on the
same page.
If you need any further details, please feel free to reach out, thanks!

RE: RDRV - Case RT252398 - 33 Camberwell Rd, Hawthorn East, VIC, 3123

I just received your email about closing my case and I'm quite confused. I thought getting a
repair date was just the beginning of solving my problems, not the end.
**The key issues I still need help with are:**
- Compensation for 70+ days of paying full rent for an unusable bedroom
- Where to stay during repairs (the agency hasn't provided any solution for this yet)
- This has now a ected my studies - my college contacted me this week about urgent matters
**I don't understand - does getting a repair date mean I can't ask about these other problems
anymore?**
Thank you so much for arranging the July 7th repair after you contacted them. It's amazing they
could suddenly arrange it after saying they needed 6-7 business days when I was asking, and I'd
already waited over two months.
I also wanted to mention that I haven't been able to conÞrm access for the repairs yet because
the agency hasn't answered any of my previous questions about what exactly will happen during
the repairs or what solutions they'll provide. From what I understand, my ßatmate and I will
need to leave our rooms during the work, which is quite a big decision that a ects both our
daily lives directly. I don't think it makes sense for me to conÞrm anything when I haven't
received any information about the details or arrangements.
I'm very sorry if I'm completely misunderstanding how this process works. As an international
student who has never dealt with anything like this before, I realize I probably don't understand
what VCAT can and cannot help with. I was hoping you might be able to guide me about what's
reasonable to expect, but I understand if I'm asking for things that aren't part of your role.
Should I just accept whatever happens with the repairs and forget about the past 70+ days and
other problems? I don't want to cause trouble, but it doesn't feel right to just forget everything
that happened.
I'm quite overwhelmed and honestly don't know what to do about the compensation and
accommodation issues. Could you please help me understand if there are options to address
these concerns even if the repairs get scheduled?
I hope it's okay to communicate in writing as phone conversations are di cult for me with
serious matters. I don't have friends or family here who understand these problems, so I'm
trying to Þgure everything out alone.
Thank you for your patience with me.
Thank you,
Chawakorn Kamnuansil

Hi Matthew,
Thank you for your email.
I have spoken with them yesterday morning and they have advised that due to their tight
schedule, they will have to look into their booking and let us know when is the next available
date.
The contractor advised that the next available date should be within the next 6-7 business
days.
Since I havenÕt received any conÞrmation, I have just sent another email to the OC and the
contractor, asking them to provide a date & time.
I will let you know once I have heard back from them.
