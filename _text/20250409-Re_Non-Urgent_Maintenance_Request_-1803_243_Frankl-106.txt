Subject: Fwd: Non-Urgent Maintenance Request (1803/243 Franklin st) Ð Broken Bed Frame with
Exposed Nails

Dear Hilary,

I hope this message Þnds you well. Thank you for your recent correspondence and for
processing my payment receipt Ñ much appreciated.

IÕm writing to follow up on a non-urgent maintenance request I originally submitted on 2 April
regarding the deteriorating bed frame in my apartment (Unit 1803, 243 Franklin Street,
Melbourne VIC 3000). As I havenÕt received a response to that email yet, I wanted to make sure
it was received and kindly ask for your guidance on the next steps.

To help move things forward without adding to your teamÕs workload, IÕd like to propose an
alternative solution Ñ if itÕs possible under your policy, IÕd be happy to purchase and install a
new bed frame myself, and then submit the o!cial receipt for reimbursement under the
maintenance allowance.

This would:
¥ Save time coordinating with contractors,
¥ Allow me to select a frame that suits my needs,
¥ And reduce the administrative load on your side.

Of course, I would only proceed if itÕs approved in advance and would comply with any
requirements you may have in terms of budget, documentation, or supplier type.

If this approach is acceptable, could you please kindly advise:
1. What the maximum reimbursable budget would be?
2. How long it typically takes for reimbursement after submitting receipts?

IÕve forwarded the original email below for your reference, along with photos and details.

Thank you very much for your time and understanding. I really appreciate your help and look
forward to hearing from you soon.

Dear Property Management Team,

I hope this message Þnds you well.

IÕm writing to report a non-urgent maintenance issue regarding the bed frame in my apartment
at Unit 1803, 243 Franklin Street, Melbourne VIC 3000. IÕve attached several photos that show
the condition of the bed clearly.

Over time, the frame has become structurally compromised due to regular usage. I can
conÞdently conÞrm that there has been no misuse on my part. Recently, the issue has worsened
Ñone side of the frame has come apart and exposed some nails. Unfortunately, I did sustain a
light scratch on my leg because of this.

The misalignment also makes it very di!cult to use the drawer underneath the bed, and the
headboard has started to detach slightly as well. Items often fall into the gap thatÕs opened up
behind the bed, and IÕm hesitant to reach in due to the protruding nails.

I understand that other tenants may be facing more urgent problems and IÕm happy to wait my
turnÑthis is not an emergency. I just wanted to make sure itÕs on record, and that it can
hopefully be addressed when itÕs suitable for your schedule.

Please feel free to reach out if you need any more details or clariÞcation. I appreciate your help
and look forward to hearing from you when possible.
