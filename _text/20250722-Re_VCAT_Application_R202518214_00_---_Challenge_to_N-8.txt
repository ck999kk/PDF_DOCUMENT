Dear Chawakorn Kamnuansil and Podjana Tienmon,
I hope you are both well.
Please find attached a copy of the VCAT order dated 21 July 2025 (Ref:
R2025/18214/00) regarding your recent application.
As noted in the order, the Tribunal has suggested that if both parties can agree, a
temporary relocation for approximately 14 days would allow the necessary repairs to be
carried out at the property. Following the completion of these works, you would be able
to return and resume your tenancy.
In line with this recommendation, we would like to offer you the opportunity to
temporarily vacate the property for a 14-day period so repairs can proceed without delay.
We are happy to coordinate dates and details with you to minimise disruption.
Please let us know your availability or any questions you may have.
Kind regards,

Sylvia Hao
