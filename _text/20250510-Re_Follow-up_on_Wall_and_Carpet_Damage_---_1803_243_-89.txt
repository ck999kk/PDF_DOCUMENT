Hi Sylvia,

Thanks for your reply. Here’s an update on the wall — although the water has dried, there is still

a visible stain and surface warping, as shown in the attached photo.

l’ve done my best to manage it temporarily using Gumption, but this is clearly not a long-term
solution and shouldn’t fall under the tenant’s responsibility.

The wall is still visibly damaged and the room remains unsuitable for normal use. | need to

know when someone will be sent to inspect and repair the affected area. This needs to be
addressed properly, not just acknowledged.

Also, for record-keeping purposes, all communication regarding this matter must be done via

email, as phone calls cannot be documented as evidence if needed.

| expect a response with a clear action plan and timeline.

Best regards,

Chawakorn

Hi Chawakorn,

Thank you for your email, and | do apologise for the lack of updates — | understand your
concerns and appreciate your continued patience.

The plumber who attended the unit last Wednesday was arranged by the Owner’s Corporation to
address the leak from the hot water system. We are currently waiting on their formal report to
confirm that the issue has been fully resolved.

In the meantime, could you please let me know if there has been any further water ingress or
signs of dampness since their visit? This will help ensure there are no ongoing issues.

Once we receive confirmation that the source of the leak is no longer active, we will arrange for
quotations to repair the internal damage, including the wall and potentially affected carpet and
underlay.

| understand how frustrating this situation is and will continue to follow up with the relevant
parties to ensure the matter is addressed appropriately.

Kind Regards,

Sylvia Hao

Hi Sylvia,

It’s been over a week since the plumber attended, and I’ve yet to see any update or progress
on the condition of my unit. | had already sent photos clearly showing wall damage — fixing

the leak alone doesn’t resolve everything.

This unit is carpeted, and the leak went on for days. It’s only logical to assume the carpet and
underlay have been affected too. Does it really make sense to think the issue ends with the

hot water pipe?

Also, why has there been complete silence? It’s not even during a public holiday period this
time, and yet I’m still left waiting with no information. Is the delay coming from the building
manager, or is the owner just not interested in maintaining their own property?

I’ve been patient long enough. Please advise what steps are being taken regarding both the
wall and the carpet, and whether an inspection will be arranged.

Regards,

Chawakorn
