Dear Matthew,
I just received your email about closing my case and I'm quite confused. I thought getting a
repair date was just the beginning of solving my problems, not the end.
**The key issues I still need help with are:**
- Compensation for 70+ days of paying full rent for an unusable bedroom
- Where to stay during repairs (the agency hasn't provided any solution for this yet)
- This has now a ected my studies - my college contacted me this week about urgent matters
**I don't understand - does getting a repair date mean I can't ask about these other problems
anymore?**
Thank you so much for arranging the July 7th repair after you contacted them. It's amazing they
could suddenly arrange it after saying they needed 6-7 business days when I was asking, and
I'd already waited over two months.
I also wanted to mention that I haven't been able to conÞrm access for the repairs yet because
the agency hasn't answered any of my previous questions about what exactly will happen during
the repairs or what solutions they'll provide. From what I understand, my ßatmate and I will
need to leave our rooms during the work, which is quite a big decision that a ects both our
daily lives directly. I don't think it makes sense for me to conÞrm anything when I haven't
received any information about the details or arrangements.
I'm very sorry if I'm completely misunderstanding how this process works. As an international
student who has never dealt with anything like this before, I realize I probably don't understand
what VCAT can and cannot help with. I was hoping you might be able to guide me about what's
reasonable to expect, but I understand if I'm asking for things that aren't part of your role.
Should I just accept whatever happens with the repairs and forget about the past 70+ days and
other problems? I don't want to cause trouble, but it doesn't feel right to just forget everything
that happened.
I'm quite overwhelmed and honestly don't know what to do about the compensation and
accommodation issues. Could you please help me understand if there are options to address
these concerns even if the repairs get scheduled?
I hope it's okay to communicate in writing as phone conversations are di cult for me with
serious matters. I don't have friends or family here who understand these problems, so I'm
trying to Þgure everything out alone.
Thank you for your patience with me.
Thank you,

Hi Matthew,
Thank you for your email.
I have spoken with them yesterday morning and they have advised that due to their tight
schedule, they will have to look into their booking and let us know when is the next available
date.
The contractor advised that the next available date should be within the next 6-7 business
days.
Since I havenÕt received any conÞrmation, I have just sent another email to the OC and the
contractor, asking them to provide a date & time.
I will let you know once I have heard back from them.

Thank you.

If not I will need to progress this matter to a hearing due to timeframes required to list urgent
repair applications.

If an agreement can be reached regarding a timeframe to resolve the repair issue this matter
can be struck out with a right of reinstatement. I have included the renters in this email for
reference.
