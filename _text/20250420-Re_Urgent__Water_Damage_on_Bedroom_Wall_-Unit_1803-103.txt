Dear Hilary and Sylvia,

I hope you are both doing well.

I am writing to kindly follow up regarding the water leakage issue in my unit (1803, 243 Franklin Street) which I Þrst reported on 16 April.

Since then, the situation has unfortunately worsened. The water damage has expanded across the ceiling and wall, and the swelling and staining have become noticeably more severe. I have attached updated photos for your reference.

I completely understand that it has been a busy period with the Easter holidays. However, given the current condition, I am concerned about the potential for further damage and health risks due to prolonged moisture.

May I kindly ask for an update regarding the next steps or any arrangements being made?
If a professional inspection could be organised soon, it would be greatly appreciated to help prevent any further complications.

Thank you very much for your time and support. I truly appreciate your help in resolving this matter.

Kind regards,
Chawakorn Kamnuansil

Subject: Urgent: Water Damage on Bedroom Wall (Unit 1803)

Dear Hilary,

IÕm contacting you regarding an urgent issue in my unit (1803, 243 Franklin Street). This evening , I noticed a water leak forming on the wall above my bed. Within a single day, it spread rapidly Ñ now forming a long vertical swelling nearly from ceiling to ßoor.

I live on the top ßoor, so this may indicate a ceiling or roof issue. IÕm concerned it could worsen quickly if not addressed.

Please arrange for a maintenance inspection as soon as possible. IÕve attached photos for reference. Let me know if I need to do anything in the meantime.

Also, IÕd appreciate an update on the status of the bed repair I previously reported.

Thanks,
Chawakorn
