Hi Chawakorn & Podjana,

Good afternoon and hope you are well.
FIXD has scheduled the repair work and we have sent out the notice of entry accordingly please refer to the attached.
Repair works are required in the bedroom due to water ingress from the common property.
Highrise Strata has appointed FIXD Trade Group to carry out these works.
Phase 1 repairs - Drying process - are scheduled for:
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8 and 9 September 2025 (excluding Sunday, 7 September 2025).
This timeframe can vary, taking either less or more days depending on drying times. Once it has

been confirmed that the drying has been completed, Phase 2 (rectification) will then begin. At
that stage, FIXD will be able to provide an estimate of works once they have fully assessed the
damage.
Access will be needed from 8:00am on these dates, though the exact times may vary from day
to day depending on how the works are progressing, drying times, and other factors that can’t
be predicted in advance. FIXD will keep you updated as the works move along and will
communicate with you about timings so you’re aware.
We thank you in advance for your cooperation and will have these works completed as quickly
as possible.

Kind Regards,

Shaun Young
