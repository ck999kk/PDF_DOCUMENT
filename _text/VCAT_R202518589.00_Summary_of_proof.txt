Application under Residential Tenancies Act 1997 challenging validity of notice to vacate - residential
Section 91ZZS
______________________________________________________________________________________
VCAT finds:
1.

The applicants have filed an application under section 91ZZS of the Residential Tenancies Act 1997
challenging the validity of a notice to vacate.

2.

The notice to vacate in question was given to the renter under section 91ZL of the Residential
Tenancies Act 1997.

3.

Section 91ZZS of the Residential Tenancies Act 1997 specifies that a renter may apply to challenge
the validity of a notice to vacate given under section 91ZX , 91ZY, 91ZZ, 91ZZA, 91ZZB or 91ZZC.
It does not allow a renter to challenge the validity of a notice to vacate given under section 91ZL.

4.

Pursuant to section 75 of the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal Act 1998, the Tribunal has
formed the view on the material before it, that the application is misconceived.

5.

The renters cannot preemptively challenge the notice to vacate. However, the renters can still
challenge the validity of the notice to vacate under section 91ZZI of the Act if the residential
rental provider applies for a possession order on the basis of the 91ZL notice to vacate
issued on 11 July 2025.

6.

The Tribunal notes that if the parties can agree on an arrangement for the renters to move
out for about 14 days, the repairs could be completed and the renters could return to the
premises.

VCAT orders:
1.

The application is struck out with a right to apply for reinstatement.

Note:

If the applicants apply for reinstatement they must provide details of why the strike out order is
opposed, including a response to the findings made by the Tribunal above.

reasonable timeframe despite multiple requests.

NOTICE TO VACATE TO RENTER OF RENTED PREMISES
INFORMATION FOR RENTERS

1. This is a notice to vacate. It tells you that the residential rental provider (rental provider) wants you to
move out by a certain date. You can find details of this date in clause 10 "Termination date" below.
2. Challenging this notice - You may be able to challenge this Notice at the Victorian Civil and Administrative
Tribunal (VCAT). Reasons to challenge a notice include:
 you believe you were given this notice due to unlawful discrimination or because you tried to exercise
your rights as a renter; or
 you believe it was not given to you properly; or
 you disagree with the reason given or the information in the form is incorrect or incomplete; or
 you have experienced family or personal violence and this caused the behavior listed in the notice to
vacate. In this case, you should apply to VCAT within 30 days after the notice has been given.
Specific timeframes may apply to certain reasons to challenge a notice. You may also challenge the validity of
the notice if the rental provider applies to VCAT for a possession order.
You should seek advice if you are considering challenging a notice to vacate.
3. Unpaid Rent
If you received a notice because you have not paid your rent  If you pay all of the unpaid rent on or before the termination date in the notice, this notice has no effect.
 However, this does not apply if you have been given four earlier notices to vacate for rent arrears within
a twelve-month period that starts either on the date your agreement commenced or the anniversary of
that date.
 You can find out more about this type of notice to vacate on the Consumer Affairs Victoria website.
4. Possession orders and warrants - Rental providers must give you the appropriate notice to vacate before they
apply to VCAT for a possession order.
If you do not vacate on the date stated in the notice, the rental provider may apply to VCAT asking for an order
requiring you to leave (a possession order). VCAT will notify you of a hearing date that you can attend. You are
encouraged to attend the hearing.
At the hearing, VCAT decides whether the rental provider was entitled to give you a notice to vacate. VCAT will
make a possession order if it is satisfied that it is reasonable and proportionate to do so. VCAT may consider
whether the notice to vacate was given in response to the act of a person who has subjected you to family or
personal violence. It may also consider whether you can comply with a payment plan for any rental arrears, if
applicable.
VCAT will decide if you must leave the property and on what date that should occur. You may ask for more time
in the property if you will be in hardship. Rental providers cannot personally use force to remove you if you
refuse to leave the property. Only Victoria Police can carry out a forcible eviction, and only when they are acting
on a VCAT order (a warrant for possession).
5. Ending the residential rental agreement earlier - In some cases, you may be able to end the residential rental
agreement (rental agreement) earlier than the termination date in the notice to vacate, if the notice is given for
one of the following reasons:
Repairs or renovations; demolition; change of use of premises; occupation by the rental provider or their family;
the premises are to be sold; the premises are required for a public purpose; the renter no longer meets the
eligibility criteria; or in the case of a fixed term rental agreement, to specify a termination date that is on or after
the date of the end of the initial fixed term of the agreement.
To notify the rental provider, use a Notice of intention to vacate form and provide at least 14 days notice.
6. Seeking advice - If you think you have grounds to challenge a notice to vacate at VCAT you should seek
advice immediately by contacting one of the community legal organisations listed on the Consumer Affairs
Victoria website. For further information visit the renting section of the Consumer Affairs Victoria website at
consumer.vic.gov.au/renting or call 1300 558 181.

Note: If you want to challenge this notice you should seek legal advice as soon as possible.
11. Reason for notice
 The rental provider must select the relevant reason, section number and the minimum notice
required under the act.
 The rental provider must also explain why the notice has been given. It is not enough to quote
just from the Act or from the reasons on the information sheet; this must be accompanied by
specific details.
 VCAT may find a notice to vacate invalid where it does not provide enough details or is not
accompanied by the required documentary evidence.
I am giving you this notice for the following reason:
Section 91ZL Unsafe premises
The premises are unfit for human habitation or have been destroyed totally, or to such an extent as to be
rendered unsafe.
A roof leak from common property caused water to enter the bedroom, resulting in swollen plaster, bubbling
paint, and visible mould. On 23 May 2025, contractor FIXD Trade Group inspected and confirmed the room is
unsafe. Urgent mould remediation is required, including sealing the room, chemical treatment, and drying using
industrial equipment. Drying is expected to take 7 days, followed by reinstatement of plaster and painting, with
the full process taking up to 14 days.
The property will be unsafe and unsuitable to occupy during this time due to noise, equipment use, and health
risks. Despite multiple written requests, the renter has refused access, preventing critical repairs.
This Notice to Vacate is issued to allow urgent works and restore the property to a habitable standard. The

renter is required to vacate by 14 July 2025.
In many cases this notice must be accompanied by documentary evidence. For information on documentary
evidence go to www.consumer.vic.gov.au/ntv
Is documentary evidence attached? Yes
Please provide details of the evidence attached:
Message Thread Franklin Street (PDF)
This includes a detailed email thread between the managing agent, contractor (FIXD Trade Group), and the
Owners Corporation. It provides:
Confirmation of mould presence and safety concerns
Scope of remediation works (drying, sealing, chemical treatment)
Estimated timeline for drying (7 days) plus reinstatement
Statement that the property is unsafe and inaccessible during the works
Contractor recommendation for the tenant to vacate
12. Delivery of this notice
 The notice period begins the day after the renter is estimated to receive this notice.
 If sending by post, the rental provider must allow for the delivery time in calculating the proposed
termination date.
 If sending by registered post, the rental provider should keep evidence of the mail delivery method used
to send this notice.
This notice was sent on 11 July 2025
This notice will be delivered

Dear Chawakorn Kamnuansil and Podjana Tienmon,
I hope you are both well.
As previously communicated, we issued a Notice to Vacate requiring the return of keys by 14
July 2025. As the keys have not been returned and possession of the property has not been
granted, we have now submitted a VCAT application (Ref: R202518589/00) to request
possession of the premises, in accordance with the owner's instructions.
Please find attached the VCAT application form and a copy of the Notice to Vacate for your
reference.
Should you have any questions or wish to discuss this matter, feel free to contact me.
Kind regards,

Hi Matthew,
We would like to bring to your attention that over the past few weeks, we have made every reasonable effort
to coordinate with the Owners Corporation (OC) and the appointed contractor, FIXD, to facilitate essential
repair works at the property. This is now our second attempt to proceed with the repairs. To clarify, all
relevant parties – including the OC, FIXD, our agency as the managing agent, and the rental provider are fully
committed to commencing and completing the necessary repairs as promptly as possible.
Page 2 of 4

We are more than willing to provide any further information the renter may reasonably request to facilitate
cooperation. However, we respectfully request that VCAT take into account that we are NOT the party
impeding progress.

Hi Chawakorn,
Please refer to below response in blue, as I have communicated with FIXD prior to this email.
I will get the remaining requested details from FIXD, but I can’t guarantee that they will reply within 24 hours.
Given that coordinating this repair requires the involvement of multiple parties and significant resources, your
cooperation is not only appreciated but essential to ensure the work can proceed without further delay.
Thank you.

Dear Johnson,
Your three Section-86 notices, lodged by registered post on 27 June 2025, seek entry at
08:00 AM on 7, 8 and 9 July—only **12 days’** lead time—and leave the “Details attached” box
unchecked. Entry therefore remains conditional.
SEND WITHIN 24 HOURS
1. Contractor legal name, licence number & 24-hour mobile – Pending FIXD’s reply
2. Day-by-day work scope (rooms, tasks, time estimates) for the full 7-day schedule The first stage of the
repair involves reducing the moisture levels in the affected bedroom, as outlined in the Notice of Entry. During
this drying process, the contractor will require daily access to the room in order to monitor and record
moisture readings. At this stage, they are unable to provide specific time estimates for this phase, as the
duration will depend on how quickly acceptable moisture levels are reached. Once the area has dried
sufficiently, they will proceed with the necessary repair work. Please note that because the contractor has not
yet assessed the current site conditions in full, they are unable to provide a definitive timeline or scope for the
repairs at this time.
3. Risk statement – water / power interruptions & noise levels - Pending FIXD’s reply
4. Public-liability / PI insurance certificate - Pending FIXD’s reply
5. “Tax invoice.pdf” **and** the alleged “tenant-confirmation” screenshot FIXD has been engaged by the
Owners Corporation, as the source of the leak originates from a common area. The OC will cover the cost of
the repairs once the work is completed. At this stage, FIXD is unable to provide a quote, as they have not yet
been able to assess the current site conditions in detail. Could you please clarify what you mean by a “tenantconfirmation screenshot”?
6. Daily-rate schedule for drying equipment **plus** written assurance that no
“no-access” surcharge will be levied without a Tribunal order As previously mentioned, FIXD is the
contractor appointed by the Owners Corporation (OC), and the OC will be covering the cost of the scheduled
works. Could you please clarify the relevance of the “daily-rate schedule for drying equipment”? There will be
no additional charges incurred, provided FIXD is granted access in accordance with the Notice of Entry and
Page 3 of 4

there are no delays caused by restricted access or obstruction to the repair process.

_No bundle → No entry → Call-out fee remains fictional._
**Provisional window (if items 1-6 arrive):** **Wed 9 Jul 2025, 15 : 30 – 19 : 00 AEST**
**Retaliatory warning** Your 27 Jun 15 : 09 email (“…deduct from your bond…”) breaches
s 264 RTA. Any repeat—or any attempt to impose daily drying fees without prior disclosure—
will trigger my application for penalty units and costs.
**Non-confirmation notice** Until items 1-6 are supplied, this email does **not** constitute
consent.
Key verbatim excerpts for easy reference:
• *Exh A – 16 Jun 04 : 37 (tenant)* “any update … I’ll reply before 12 : 00 …”
• *Exh B – 16 Jun 11 : 52 (agent)* “Thanks so much … **for confirming** …”
• *Exh C – 23 Jun 14 : 35 (agent)* “remediation work … 24 Jun 08 : 30 … provide access …”
• *Exh D – 27 Jun 15 : 09 (agent)* “**we will deduct it from your bond**.”
Your own notices concede the job “might be extended subject to the length of the drying
process” yet provide no timeline or cost caps. Please resolve that conflict by supplying
items 1-6 above.

Hi Chawakorn,
Good evening and hope you're both doing well.
IÕm following up on my previous email regarding the compensation from the OC.
Please know that IÕm here to assist and help explore the best possible options for you.
At the end of the day, our shared goal is to have the issue resolved as quickly and smoothly as possible.
Page 2 of 4

I completely understand your concerns about staying in the property during the repair work.
When FIXD inspected the property back in May, the initial estimate for the job duration was over 7 Ð 10 days.
However, due to the delays, the condition might have been deteriorated. Hence, FIXD is unable to provide a
timeframe of the work.
As I have not yet received a confirmed response from the OC regarding the $800 compensation offer, I would
like to outline some options for you to consider:
1. Seek temporary accommodation during the works, and submit a reimbursement claim to the OC, who is
ultimately responsible for the leak. While this is a valid option, I must note that we cannot guarantee the
outcome of their approval.
2. Early lease termination without penalty. If you feel the property will be uninhabitable during the repairs
and would prefer not to take the risk of seeking compensation from the OC, the rental provider is willing to
allow you to break the fixed-term lease early with no penalties.
3. If you would like to further escalate this, you can have the OC joined as a party to residential tenancy
application at VCAT
Please let us know which option you would prefer, or if thereÕs anything else we can do to support you.
Thank you again, and wishing you a pleasant evening.

Hi Chawakorn,
Thank you for your email.
I would like to seek clarification on one thing, which I havenÕt received a certain answer yet.
I can see that there is a $800 compensation, offered by the OC.
Is that compensation amount meant to be compensating the inconvenience during the work?
If so, I believe that is the reason why the OC didnÕt offer an alternative accommodation for this job.
If no, can you please forward the email of you rejecting that offer?
Thank you Chawakorn.

Dear Sylvia,

I am writing with the intent of resolving this matter constructively and without escalation, if possible.

Over the past two months, I have reported the water damage issue multiple times in good faith, cooperated with your office, and done my best to
remain in the property despite the difficulties. I am not trying to be confrontational; I simply need a clear and reasonable outcome, supported by
appropriate action and communication.

Please find attached:
1. A formal demand letter outlining my request for rent compensation, a firm repair timeline, and confirmation of non-liability Ð based on my rights
under the Residential Tenancies Act 1997 (VIC).
2. A supporting tenant statement summarising the verbal communication with your office around 2Ð3 June 2025, including the temporary
accommodation proposal and its impractical conditions.

If a fair and written resolution is not reached within five (5) business days, I will have no choice but to initiate proceedings through VCAT. I sincerely
hope this can be avoided and that we can achieve a reasonable solution for all parties involved.

I would appreciate your written response at your earliest convenience.

Dear Chawakorn,
Thank you for your email and the supporting documents outlining your concerns and formal request.
We understand the impact this situation has had on your tenancy and appreciate the way youÕve approached the matter. We will now forward your
request and documentation to the Owners Corporation for consideration of a rent compensation claim based on the current circumstances.
In the meantime, we are aiming to proceed with the repair works as soon as possible. Could you kindly confirm whether works can commence on
Thursday, 6 June 2025, or let us know your earliest availability to provide access?
We will continue to keep you updated as we receive further information from the Owners Corporation.
Kind regards,

Sylvia Hao

Dear Sylvia,
Thank you for your response dated Friday, 6 June 2025 at 11:50am.
As the primary resident of the property who has lived through weeks of unresolved water damage, I must reiterate that no one is more eager than I
am to see the situation resolved quickly and properly. However, I am currently unable to provide consent for any repair work to begin.
Firstly, your email referred to repairs commencing on "Thursday, 6 June"a date which had already passed at the time of your message. This
inconsistency is not just confusing; it is logistically impossible and calls into question the seriousness of the repair planning. Such unclear and lastminute communication cannot form the basis for valid consent.

Page 2 of 13

Secondly, I must emphasise that I cannot authorise access until the following points are clearly confirmed in writing:
1. A definitive and specific repair timeline, including projected completion date.
2. Whether temporary relocation will be required, and if so, what arrangements or compensation are being offered.
3. Your position on my formal request for rent reduction and confirmation of non-liability, which remain outstanding.
4. Acknowledgment of the impact on my co-tenant, who is also named in the lease agreement, and who will equally be affected by noise and
accessibility issues related to the drying equipment.
It is my responsibility to ensure that any agreement made does not inadvertently waive our legal rights or create further hardship. I must act
cautiously, especially as the installation of industrial drying equipment operating 24/7 poses real disturbancessomething your office acknowledged in
our previous phone call.
If I were to consent now without these matters resolved in writing, it could later be used to suggest that I accepted all resulting conditions, which I
absolutely do not.
Therefore, I will only provide access once I receive formal written confirmation addressing all points above. Until then, I consider it unreasonable to
demand a commitment from me, especially under these unclear and one-sided circumstances.
As noted in my formal demand, if a resolution is not reached within five (5) calendar daysincluding weekendsI will proceed to file an application with
VCAT.
Kind regards,
Chawakorn Kamnuansil

Re: Rent Adjustment Ð Request for Clarification and Meeting (12 June)

From:

Chawakorn Kamnuansil (ck.chawakorn@gmail.com)

Message type:

Dear Sylvia,

Thank you again for your recent update, and for forwarding the proposed rent adjustment of $800.

As IÕve mentioned previously, IÕm still very open to resolving this matter directly and as fairly as possible, given the nature and duration of the
disruption.

Before I can respond to the proposed amount, IÕd really appreciate your clarification on a few key points, just so thereÕs no confusion going forward:
¥ How exactly was the $800 figure calculated?
¥ What time period does it cover?
¥ Does it reflect one tenant or both of us?
¥ If accepted, would that payment mean I canÕt raise other issues like earlier disruption or temporary accommodation?
¥ And whatÕs the current expected repair timeline?

From my side, IÕve been looking at the impact from around 15 April, which is when the issue started and when I first reached out. So I hope that
context can be considered as part of your teamÕs preparation before we meet. It would really help if everything could be brought or explained clearly
during the discussion, so we donÕt go in circles.

To keep things moving forward, IÕd like to propose an in-person meeting at your office on Thursday, 12 June at 10:30 AM. IÕll be bringing a support
person with me as well. Nothing formal Ñ just someone to help me navigate things clearly.

If this time doesnÕt work for your team, please let me know by 9:00 AM Thursday. If I donÕt hear back by then, IÕll assume the meeting canÕt go ahead
as suggested and will take the next steps from there.

Thank you again Ñ IÕm still hopeful we can bring this to a clear and fair resolution.

Kind regards,
Chawakorn Kamnuansil

Dear Chawakorn,
I hope you're well, and thank you again for your continued engagement regarding the repair matter.
Following instructions from the rental provider, we are now arranging to proceed with the required repairs to the water-damaged wall and flooring.
These works are necessary to prevent further deterioration of the property.
To ensure works can commence without further delay, please expect a formal Notice of Entry to be issued on Monday, 16 June 2025. This is in
accordance with the Residential Tenancies Act and will confirm the entry date and time for the Owners CorporationÕs contractors to attend.
As previously advised, the repair process is estimated to take approximately 7Ð12 days. If you have any preferred times or specific availability for the
week ahead, please feel free to share this by 12:00 PM Monday, 16 June, and weÕll do our best to coordinate accordingly. However, please note that
access must be provided to prevent further damage and comply with maintenance obligations.
In terms of rent compensation, a rent credit of $800 will be applied and reflected on your ledger. This offer has been confirmed by the rental provider
as final, with no further compensation to be considered.
If you feel the current tenancy no longer suits your circumstances, the owner is open to discussing a mutual lease termination, without penalty, should
you wish to explore that option.
Please donÕt hesitate to reach out with any further questions or concerns Ñ we remain committed to a timely and fair resolution.
Warm regards,

Sylvia Hao

Good afternoon and hope you are well.
Sylvia is currently on leave and will be back on 7 July.
Just a quick reminder that the remediation work will be commenced on tomorrow (24 June) at 8:30AM.
Please ensure you will be able to provide access for the trade.

Dear Johnson,

Thank you for your message. And honestly, IÕm relieved to hear from someone new, because I donÕt feel that Sylvia Hao ever fully understood what
IÕve been trying to say from the start.

Happy holiday to Sylvia Ñ I hope sheÕs having a relaxing break. I wish I could take one too under the current circumstances.

I kindly ask you to take a moment to review my past emails. At no point did I confirm that I agreed to the works or gave consent to proceed. In fact,
IÕve repeatedly asked Sylvia for proper information and clarification, which I never received. The only thing I said was that I might be out of touch Ñ
which I clearly explained was because I needed a break from all this due to how much stress it had caused me. And now, after several days of
silence, I suddenly receive a reminder that the works are happening tomorrow?

I have no idea whatÕs going to happen to me tomorrow.

YouÕre asking me to provide access for something I was never truly consulted on. I was not given 14 daysÕ notice. And more importantly Ñ where do
you actually expect me to stay? I just paid $2,825 in rent. I have no money for a second place. I canÕt share a bedroom with my co-tenant. And no one
from your office, including Sylvia, has ever addressed that properly.

If this is the agencyÕs internal policy Ñ to carry out major internal works while offering no accommodation or practical alternatives to the tenant Ñ then
please confirm that to me clearly. It would actually be helpful for me to have that confirmed, because I have now submitted this matter to VCAT and
am preparing to provide a complete record of whatÕs happened.

Again, I am not refusing access. I am simply asking a question that no one has answered: where am I supposed to stay?

Also, please do not attempt to contact me by phone. I will not answer any calls. All communication must be in writing by email, as phone calls cannot

Hi Chawakorn,
Thank you for your reply. I want to start by sincerely apologising for the inconvenience and frustration this ongoing issue has caused you. I truly
understand how disruptive this must be, and I appreciate your continued patience throughout.
After reviewing the communication trail, I want to clarify that the source of the leak originates from a common area of the building, which falls under
the Owners Corporation's (OC) responsibility. As a result, all scheduling and repair works need to be coordinated through them. Unfortunately, this
has contributed to the delays, and I understand how frustrating that can be.
To address your first question: Sylvia did send an email on 18 June 2025 to both you and Podjana once the OC confirmed the appointment details.
IÕve attached a screenshot of that email for your reference. ItÕs possible it was missed, but IÕm glad to hear that youÕll be able to provide access
tomorrow.
Regarding alternative accommodation, it was my understanding that the agreed $800 compensation was intended to help offset those costs. If IÕve
misunderstood or missed anything, please do let me knowÑthereÕs been a lot of emails, and I want to ensure nothing important is overlooked. The
amount will be set as rent credit once the repair is commenced.
Again, I truly empathise with your situation. From what IÕve seen, Sylvia has been doing her utmost to keep communication flowing between all parties
involvedÑyourself, the rental provider, the OC, and their plumber. Unfortunately, her ability to act is limited when the responsible party is not as
responsive as we would hope.
Please rest assured that we will continue to follow up closely and advocate for this to be resolved as quickly as possible.

Hi Chawakon,

I hope you're both safe and well.
IÕve just been informed by the contractor arranged by the Owners Corporation that they were unable to carry out the scheduled repair work this
morning due to an access issue. They mentioned they rang both the intercom and your mobile but unfortunately couldnÕt get through.
After waiting for approximately an hour, they had no choice but to leave the building. As a result, they will need to charge the OC for the call-out and
arrange a new time for the job to be completed.
Our primary concern is to ensure everything is okay on your end, especially as we havenÕt heard from you today.
Please let us know that you're safe when you get a moment, and weÕll work with the OC to coordinate a new appointment as soon as possible.

Dear Johnson,
Thank you for your follow-up regarding events. I sincerely apologize for any inconvenience caused.
I want to clarify that I have never refused access for necessary repairs. The situation on 24 June occurred due to inadequate advance communication
about the specific scheduling and requirements, which left me unprepared for the visit.
I genuinely regret that the contractor's time was affected, and I understand this may have caused complications for the scheduling process.
As this matter is now being handled through the formal dispute resolution process (Case RT252398), I believe all repair coordination should proceed
through the official RDRV channel to ensure proper documentation and clarity for all parties moving forward.
I remain committed to resolving this matter constructively and cooperatively, and I look forward to working with the Resolution Coordinator to establish
an appropriate process that works for everyone involved.
Thank you for your understanding, and I apologize again for yesterday's circumstances.
Regards,
Chawakorn Kamnuansil
