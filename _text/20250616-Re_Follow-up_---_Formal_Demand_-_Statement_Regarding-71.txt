Dear Chawakorn,
I hope you're well, and thank you again for your continued engagement regarding the repair
matter.
Following instructions from the rental provider, we are now arranging to proceed with the required
repairs to the water-damaged wall and flooring. These works are necessary to prevent further
deterioration of the property.
To ensure works can commence without further delay, please expect a formal Notice of Entry to
be issued on Monday, 16 June 2025. This is in accordance with the Residential Tenancies Act and
will confirm the entry date and time for the Owners CorporationÕs contractors to attend.
As previously advised, the repair process is estimated to take approximately 7Ð12 days. If you
have any preferred times or specific availability for the week ahead, please feel free to share this
by 12:00 PM Monday, 16 June, and weÕll do our best to coordinate accordingly. However, please
note that access must be provided to prevent further damage and comply with maintenance
obligations.
In terms of rent compensation, a rent credit of $800 will be applied and reflected on your ledger.
This offer has been confirmed by the rental provider as final, with no further compensation to be
considered.

If you feel the current tenancy no longer suits your circumstances, the owner is open to
discussing a mutual lease termination, without penalty, should you wish to explore that option.
Please donÕt hesitate to reach out with any further questions or concerns Ñ we remain committed
to a timely and fair resolution.
Warm regards,

Sylvia Hao

Dear Sylvia,
IÕve taken some time to reflect on the communication surrounding this matter Ñ not just
in the past few days, but throughout the entire process.

The meeting times proposed in your recent email were sent without any acknowledgement
of my previous proposal, no explanation for the lack of response to the 9:00 AM deadline I
had clearly stated, and no apology for the time and preparation that were disregarded
when your office failed to respond. That silence, in itself, said a great deal.
In addition, the questions I have raised Ñ including the breakdown of the $800 figure, the
repair timeline, and the specific conditions affecting my tenancy Ñ have still not been
addressed in writing. These are matters that should be readily available to your team, and
I find it concerning that they remain unanswered despite repeated and reasonable
requests.
IÕve done my best to remain cooperative, flexible, and patient, even though I am the one
living with the ongoing impact. But based on the way this has been handled, I no longer
believe that an in-person meeting will lead to any meaningful resolution Ñ especially when
my time and concerns have not been respected.
Accordingly, I will not be attending any further meetings. From this point forward, I will
only continue this matter through formal written communication. If that clarity is not
provided, I will proceed with the appropriate next steps without further notice.
I have made every effort to avoid escalation. If communication continues in this pattern,
the matter will simply follow its natural course.

the following options for a meeting on Friday, 13 June:
Any time between 11:30 AM and 12:30 PM, or

Dear Sylvia,

Thank you again for your recent update, and for forwarding the proposed rent
adjustment of $800.

As IÕve mentioned previously, IÕm still very open to resolving this matter directly and as
fairly as possible, given the nature and duration of the disruption.

Before I can respond to the proposed amount, IÕd really appreciate your clarification on
a few key points, just so thereÕs no confusion going forward:

¥
How exactly was the $800 figure calculated?
¥
What time period does it cover?
¥
Does it reflect one tenant or both of us?
¥
If accepted, would that payment mean I canÕt raise other issues like earlier disruption
or temporary accommodation?
¥
And whatÕs the current expected repair timeline?

From my side, IÕve been looking at the impact from around 15 April, which is when the
issue started and when I first reached out. So I hope that context can be considered as
part of your teamÕs preparation before we meet. It would really help if everything could
be brought or explained clearly during the discussion, so we donÕt go in circles.

To keep things moving forward, IÕd like to propose an in-person meeting at your office
on Thursday, 12 June at 10:30 AM. IÕll be bringing a support person with me as well.
Nothing formal Ñ just someone to help me navigate things clearly.

Re: Follow-up Ð Formal Demand & Statement Regarding Unresolved Repairs (Unit 1803)

If this time doesnÕt work for your team, please let me know by 9:00 AM Thursday. If I
donÕt hear back by then, IÕll assume the meeting canÕt go ahead as suggested and will
take the next steps from there.

Thank you again Ñ IÕm still hopeful we can bring this to a clear and fair resolution.

Kind regards,
Chawakorn Kamnuansil

Re: Follow-up Ð Formal Demand & Statement Regarding Unresolved Repairs (Unit 1803)

Repair Timeline:
We have formally submitted your 30% rent reduction request to the
Owners Corporation and are awaiting their response. Once we receive
their feedback, we will provide you with a confirmed repair timeline and
projected completion date.
Temporary Relocation:
As discussed, the affected bedroom will need to be vacant during the
repair work, including the installation of drying equipment.
Co-Tenant Impact:
We recognize that your co-tenant will also be affected by these repairs.
Please rest assured that we will keep both of you informed about the
repair schedule and any potential disruptions.
We fully respect your decision to withhold consent until these matters are
fully addressed in writing. We are working to resolve this as quickly as
possible and will provide all the necessary details as soon as they are
available.
If you have any further questions or need additional clarification, please
donÕt hesitate to reach out.
Kind regards,

Sylvia Hao
