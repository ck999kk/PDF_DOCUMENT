Dear Sylvia,

I am writing with the intent of resolving this matter constructively and without escalation, if
possible.

Over the past two months, I have reported the water damage issue multiple times in good faith,
cooperated with your o!ce, and done my best to remain in the property despite the di!culties.
I am not trying to be confrontational; I simply need a clear and reasonable outcome, supported
by appropriate action and communication.

Please Þnd attached:
1. A formal demand letter outlining my request for rent compensation, a Þrm repair timeline,
and conÞrmation of non-liability Ð based on my rights under the Residential Tenancies Act
1997 (VIC).
2. A supporting tenant statement summarising the verbal communication with your o!ce
around 2Ð3 June 2025, including the temporary accommodation proposal and its
impractical conditions.

If a fair and written resolution is not reached within Þve (5) business days, I will have no choice
but to initiate proceedings through VCAT. I sincerely hope this can be avoided and that we can
achieve a reasonable solution for all parties involved.

I would appreciate your written response at your earliest convenience.

Kind regards,
Chawakorn Kamnuansil
