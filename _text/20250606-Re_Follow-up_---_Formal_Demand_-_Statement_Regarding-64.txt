current circumstances.

Could you kindly confirm whether works can commence on Thursday, 6 June 2025, or let

Re: Follow-up Ð Formal Demand & Statement Regarding Unresolved Repairs (Unit 1803)

Dear Sylvia,

I am writing with the intent of resolving this matter constructively and without
escalation, if possible.

Over the past two months, I have reported the water damage issue multiple times in
good faith, cooperated with your office, and done my best to remain in the property
despite the difficulties. I am not trying to be confrontational; I simply need a clear and
reasonable outcome, supported by appropriate action and communication.

Please find attached:

1.
A formal demand letter outlining my request for rent compensation, a firm repair
timeline, and confirmation of non-liability Ð based on my rights under the Residential
Tenancies Act 1997 (VIC).
2.
A supporting tenant statement summarising the verbal communication with your office
around 2Ð3 June 2025, including the temporary accommodation proposal and its
impractical conditions.

If a fair and written resolution is not reached within five (5) business days, I will have
no choice but to initiate proceedings through VCAT. I sincerely hope this can be avoided
and that we can achieve a reasonable solution for all parties involved.

I would appreciate your written response at your earliest convenience.

Kind regards,
Chawakorn Kamnuansil
