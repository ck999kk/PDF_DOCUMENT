Hi Chawakorn,
I hope you're well.
Following our recent discussions regarding the damage in the bedroom and the upcoming remediation
works, I wanted to provide you with an update.
The cause of the leak and damage has been identified as originating from the common roof, which falls
under the responsibility of the Owners Corporation (Highrise Strata). WeÕve approached them regarding
possible rent compensation for the temporary loss of use of the affected bedroom.
While this type of situation doesnÕt meet the insurance excess threshold for a formal claim, the Owners
Corporation has advised they may consider a rent reduction of approximately 10% to 30% during the
works, depending on the impact and supporting documentation.
To proceed, they require a formal written request from you, outlining:
Your request for rent compensation;
The amount requested (e.g., 30%);
A brief explanation (e.g., inability to use the bedroom due to drying equipment or repairs).
I'm more than happy to support a request for the higher end of the range (30%) on your behalf. Please
let me know if youÕre comfortable with this, and feel free to send me your formal request so we can
submit it to the Owners Corporation for review.
If you have any questions or need help wording your request, IÕm here to assist.
Looking forward to hearing from you.
Warm regards,

Sylvia Hao

Dear Sylvia,

Thank you for your email.

I confirm that access to the bedroom can be provided as required to facilitate the scheduled repairs. I
will ensure that personal items are removed in time.

However, I must formally note that the water intrusion, plaster damage, and associated issues have
been ongoing since approximately 15 April 2025. I submitted multiple written reports, yet no action
was taken to mitigate the impact for several weeks. This has resulted in substantial disruption and
compromised my ability to safely and reasonably occupy the premises.

Given this, I request that your office assess and propose an appropriate rent reduction or
compensation, in line with the responsibilities of the rental provider under the Residential Tenancies Act
1997 (VIC). The current circumstances reflect a clear breach of my right to quiet enjoyment, as well as
your obligation to attend to urgent repairs in a timely manner.

I also wish to express concern regarding the proposed solution that I relocate for the duration of
repairs without any logistical or financial support. It is not reasonable to expect me to independently
secure alternative accommodation within a constrained budget. The responsibility for this situation
does not rest with me, and I cannot be expected to bear its consequences. Furthermore, while I
appreciate the ownerÕs offer to stay at their Mount Waverley residence, I must respectfully decline. My
daily activities, work, and personal needs are based in the city, and any temporary solution must
reflect the realities of my lifestyle and commitments.

I will cooperate within reason, but I ask that the proposed solution be revisited in good faith to ensure
it does not transfer the burden to me for a matter caused by delays in your agencyÕs response.

Please also note that I will not accept any further contact by telephone. All future communication must
be conducted via email only to avoid disruption to my work and to maintain a written record.

If no compensation or reasonable resolution is offered within five business days, I will consider
escalating the matter by submitting a formal application to the Victorian Civil and Administrative
Tribunal (VCAT). I remain open to resolving this amicably, but the solution must be fair, timely, and
consistent with the facts of the situation.

Hi Podjana,
Thank you for your time on the phone earlier.
As discussed, there is potential mould growth and further damage to the carpet and plaster in
the affected bedroom. The building strata and property owners are actively pursuing
remediation works to prevent further deterioration.
To move forward, we kindly ask for your confirmation regarding access to the bedroom so that
the necessary works can proceed.
Please confirm at your earliest convenience.
Kind regards,

Hi Charwakorn,
Just a quick updateÑOC contractor has confirmed that one of the affected rooms will
need to remain inaccessible during the drying process. Drying equipment will be placed
in that bedroom, and please note it does emit a moderate level of noise and
unfortunately cannot be switched off during operation.
If you prefer not to move out during this period, you're welcome to share the second

access can be arranged for the drying equipment to be installed?
Let us know what works best for you, and weÕll do our best to assist.

Hi Chawakorn,
Thank you for your detailed update and the photo.
IÕve followed up with the Owners Corporation to confirm that the leak has been
resolved, and IÕve requested that the necessary rectification works be arranged
without further delay. IÕve also asked them to provide a clear timeline for
inspection and repairs.
I understand the inconvenience this has caused and appreciate your continued
patience. IÕll keep you updated as soon as I receive a confirmed plan from their
side.
Best regards,

Sylvia Hao

Hi Sylvia,

Thanks for your reply. HereÕs an update on the wall Ñ although the water has
dried, there is still a visible stain and surface warping, as shown in the attached
photo.

IÕve done my best to manage it temporarily using Gumption, but this is clearly
not a long-term solution and shouldnÕt fall under the tenantÕs responsibility.

The wall is still visibly damaged and the room remains unsuitable for normal use.
I need to know when someone will be sent to inspect and repair the affected
area. This needs to be addressed properly, not just acknowledged.

Also, for record-keeping purposes, all communication regarding this matter must
be done via email, as phone calls cannot be documented as evidence if needed.

I expect a response with a clear action plan and timeline.

Best regards,
Chawakorn

Hi Chawakorn,

Thank you for your email, and I do apologise for the lack of updates Ñ I understand
your concerns and appreciate your continued patience.

The plumber who attended the unit last Wednesday was arranged by the OwnerÕs

Corporation to address the leak from the hot water system. We are currently waiting
on their formal report to conÞrm that the issue has been fully resolved.

In the meantime, could you please let me know if there has been any further water
ingress or signs of dampness since their visit? This will help ensure there are no
ongoing issues.

Once we receive conÞrmation that the source of the leak is no longer active, we will
arrange for quotations to repair the internal damage, including the wall and
potentially a ected carpet and underlay.

I understand how frustrating this situation is and will continue to follow up with the
relevant parties to ensure the matter is addressed appropriately.
