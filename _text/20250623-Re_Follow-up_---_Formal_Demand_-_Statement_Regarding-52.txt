Dear Chawakorn,
I hope you're well, and thank you again for your continued engagement regarding the repair
matter.
Following instructions from the rental provider, we are now arranging to proceed with the required
repairs to the water-damaged wall and flooring. These works are necessary to prevent further
deterioration of the property.
To ensure works can commence without further delay, please expect a formal Notice of Entry to
be issued on Monday, 16 June 2025. This is in accordance with the Residential Tenancies Act and
will confirm the entry date and time for the Owners CorporationÕs contractors to attend.
As previously advised, the repair process is estimated to take approximately 7Ð12 days. If you
have any preferred times or specific availability for the week ahead, please feel free to share this
by 12:00 PM Monday, 16 June, and weÕll do our best to coordinate accordingly. However, please
note that access must be provided to prevent further damage and comply with maintenance
obligations.
In terms of rent compensation, a rent credit of $800 will be applied and reflected on your ledger.
This offer has been confirmed by the rental provider as final, with no further compensation to be
considered.

If you feel the current tenancy no longer suits your circumstances, the owner is open to
discussing a mutual lease termination, without penalty, should you wish to explore that option.
Please donÕt hesitate to reach out with any further questions or concerns Ñ we remain committed
to a timely and fair resolution.
Warm regards,

Sylvia Hao

Dear Sylvia,
IÕve taken some time to reflect on the communication surrounding this matter Ñ not just in
the past few days, but throughout the entire process.

The meeting times proposed in your recent email were sent without any acknowledgement
of my previous proposal, no explanation for the lack of response to the 9:00 AM deadline I
had clearly stated, and no apology for the time and preparation that were disregarded
when your office failed to respond. That silence, in itself, said a great deal.
In addition, the questions I have raised Ñ including the breakdown of the $800 figure, the
repair timeline, and the specific conditions affecting my tenancy Ñ have still not been
addressed in writing. These are matters that should be readily available to your team, and
I find it concerning that they remain unanswered despite repeated and reasonable
requests.
IÕve done my best to remain cooperative, flexible, and patient, even though I am the one
living with the ongoing impact. But based on the way this has been handled, I no longer
believe that an in-person meeting will lead to any meaningful resolution Ñ especially when
my time and concerns have not been respected.
Accordingly, I will not be attending any further meetings. From this point forward, I will
only continue this matter through formal written communication. If that clarity is not
provided, I will proceed with the appropriate next steps without further notice.
I have made every effort to avoid escalation. If communication continues in this pattern,
the matter will simply follow its natural course.

Sincerely,

30/8/68, 16:50

Dear Chawakorn,
Thank you for your thoughtful response and for your continued openness to resolving this
matter collaboratively.
We understand the importance of your questions regarding the proposed rent

through all the details and reach a clear understanding together.
We would like to invite you to our office at 33 Camberwell Road, Hawthorn East, and offer
the following options for a meeting on Friday, 13 June:
Any time between 11:30 AM and 12:30 PM, or
Any time between 2:00 PM and 3:00 PM (please let us know your preferred time within
that window).
You are welcome to bring your support person, and weÕll ensure all relevant
documentation and responses are prepared in advance for review and discussion.
Please confirm your availability at your earliest convenience, and weÕll lock in the time
accordingly.
Kind regards,

Sylvia Hao

Re: Follow-up Ð Formal Demand & Statement Regarding Unresolved Repairs (Unit 1803)

Thank you again for your recent update, and for forwarding the proposed rent
adjustment of $800.

As IÕve mentioned previously, IÕm still very open to resolving this matter directly and as
fairly as possible, given the nature and duration of the disruption.

Before I can respond to the proposed amount, IÕd really appreciate your clarification on
a few key points, just so thereÕs no confusion going forward:

¥
How exactly was the $800 figure calculated?
¥
What time period does it cover?
¥
Does it reflect one tenant or both of us?
¥
If accepted, would that payment mean I canÕt raise other issues like earlier disruption
or temporary accommodation?
¥
And whatÕs the current expected repair timeline?

From my side, IÕve been looking at the impact from around 15 April, which is when the
issue started and when I first reached out. So I hope that context can be considered as
part of your teamÕs preparation before we meet. It would really help if everything could
be brought or explained clearly during the discussion, so we donÕt go in circles.

To keep things moving forward, IÕd like to propose an in-person meeting at your office
on Thursday, 12 June at 10:30 AM. IÕll be bringing a support person with me as well.
Nothing formal Ñ just someone to help me navigate things clearly.

If this time doesnÕt work for your team, please let me know by 9:00 AM Thursday. If I
donÕt hear back by then, IÕll assume the meeting canÕt go ahead as suggested and will
take the next steps from there.

Thank you again Ñ IÕm still hopeful we can bring this to a clear and fair resolution.

Owners Corporation and are awaiting their response. Once we receive

repair work, including the installation of drying equipment.
