Dear Chawakorn Kamnuansil and Podjana Tienmon,
I hope you are both well.
As previously communicated, we issued a Notice to Vacate requiring the return of keys
by 14 July 2025. As the keys have not been returned and possession of the property has
not been granted, we have now submitted a VCAT application (Ref: R202518589/00) to
request possession of the premises, in accordance with the owner's instructions.
Please find attached the VCAT application form and a copy of the Notice to Vacate for
your reference.
Should you have any questions or wish to discuss this matter, feel free to contact me.
Kind regards,

Sylvia Hao
