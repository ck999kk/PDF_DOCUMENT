Hi Chawakorn,
Thanks so much for checking in and for confirming.

through an update as soon as we hear back from their team.
If anything comes through today, IÕll definitely pass it on.

just wondering if thereÕs any update on the general repair days or schedule?
if you have anything rough before 9:30 monday, feel free to send it through, just so I can sort out what to
do
not a big deal either way, just thought IÕd check
iÕll probably just reply before 12:00 like you mentioned
might be out of touch after that
thanks

Dear Chawakorn,
I hope you're well, and thank you again for your continued engagement regarding the repair
matter.
Following instructions from the rental provider, we are now arranging to proceed with the required
repairs to the water-damaged wall and flooring. These works are necessary to prevent further
deterioration of the property.
