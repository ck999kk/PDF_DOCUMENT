More details about the claim are
This application challenges the validity
of a Notice to Vacate dated 11 July
2025 issued by Areal Property Hawthorn.
The notice constitutes retaliatory
eviction under Section 91ZZE of the
Residential Tenancies Act 1997 (Vic),
issued in direct response to legitimate
maintenance complaints regarding water
damage in the bedroom wall reported on
16 April 2025.
Timeline evidence shows the landlord's
pattern of hostility following our VCAT
application RT252398 (lodged 24 June
2025, withdrawn 27 June 2025), with the
retaliatory notice issued just 14 days
after case withdrawal.
We seek orders declaring the notice
invalid and preventing eviction based on
retaliatory conduct.
