Hi Chawakorn,
Thank you for your email.
I would like to seek clariÞcation on one thing, which I havenÕt received a certain answer yet.
I can see that there is a $800 compensation, o ered by the OC.
Is that compensation amount meant to be compensating the inconvenience during the work?
If so, I believe that is the reason why the OC didnÕt o er an alternative accommodation for this
job.
If no, can you please forward the email of you rejecting that o er?
Thank you Chawakorn.

Kind Regards,
Johnson Tan

Hi Johnson,
Resending thisÑjust to be sure it doesnÕt get lost in whichever account you feel like using
today.
Consider it a polite note that swapping signatures and email headers doesnÕt erase whatÕs
actually happened here, or who is responsible.

Regards,
Chawakorn

Dear Johnson,
For clarity and to avoid further confusion:
Where, precisely, are we expected to sleep while industrial dryers operate in our only
bedroom?
For how many days? What speciÞc arrangements have you made to ensure we are not left
without habitable space?
LetÕs be absolutely clear: I never conÞrmed anything. There is no message in which I agreedÑ
because none exists.
It is remarkable that after over two months of delay, the only certainty you can o er is the
threat of charges if access is deniedÑyet you remain unable to answer the most basic question
about where your tenants will live.
If Sylvia chose to claim ÒconÞrmationÓ on my behalf, perhaps the cost of this entire
situation belongs with her, not me.
I look forward to seeing whether you can provide an actual plan rather than more excuses.

To Johnson,
This email is a formal response to the multiple, legally defective 'Notice to Renter'
documents issued by Areal Property. It outlines your non-compliance and contains a
final demand for action.
Let us first establish the facts, based entirely on your own actions and documentation:
1. Your Notices Are Invalid: You deliberately marked "NO" on your own forms,

formally declaring no details were attached. This renders them defective under
the RTA.
2. You Have Fabricated Evidence: You have repeatedly relied on a nonexistent "tenant-confirmation" to support your false narrative.
3. Abdication of Professional Duty: Your notice directs me to seek help from
Consumer Affairs Victoria. This is a formal admission of your failure to perform
your duties as an agent, attempting to outsource your responsibilities to me.

After 70+ days of this conduct, the direct result of your failures is that one simple,
fundamental question remains unanswered. The proposed work is in our only bedroom.
Sylvia's unprofessional suggestion to "stay at a friend's place" is not a solution.
Therefore, a singular, fundamental question requires your immediate attention:
Where, precisely, are my roommate and I supposed to live while our bedroom is a
work site?
To be clear, any refusal of entry based on an unworkable or unreasonable planÑsimilar
to the unhelpful suggestions you have provided in the pastÑwill not be considered a
breach on my part. The responsibility to provide a viable, respectful solution rests
entirely with you. Consider this carefully.
I require your clear, written plan for suitable temporary accommodation by 5:00 PM
tomorrow, 4 July 2025.
If you fail to provide this plan by the deadline, I will, without further notice, file an urgent
application with VCAT and a formal complaint with Consumer Affairs Victoria. The
complaint will detail the entire pattern of conduct outlined in this email, including your
issuance of defective legal documents, fabrication of evidence, and abdication of
professional duties.
