Dear Chawakorn,
I hope you're well, and thank you again for your continued engagement regarding the repair matter.
Following instructions from the rental provider, we are now arranging to proceed with the required repairs
to the water-damaged wall and flooring. These works are necessary to prevent further deterioration of the
property.
To ensure works can commence without further delay, please expect a formal Notice of Entry to be issued
on Monday, 16 June 2025. This is in accordance with the Residential Tenancies Act and will confirm the
entry date and time for the Owners CorporationÕs contractors to attend.
As previously advised, the repair process is estimated to take approximately 7Ð12 days. If you have any
preferred times or specific availability for the week ahead, please feel free to share this by 12:00 PM
Monday, 16 June, and weÕll do our best to coordinate accordingly. However, please note that access must
be provided to prevent further damage and comply with maintenance obligations.
In terms of rent compensation, a rent credit of $800 will be applied and reflected on your ledger. This offer
has been confirmed by the rental provider as final, with no further compensation to be considered.
If you feel the current tenancy no longer suits your circumstances, the owner is open to discussing a
mutual lease termination, without penalty, should you wish to explore that option.
Please donÕt hesitate to reach out with any further questions or concerns Ñ we remain committed to a
timely and fair resolution.
Warm regards,

Sylvia Hao

Re: Follow-up Ð Formal Demand & Statement Regarding Unresolved Repairs (Unit 1803)

Dear Sylvia,
IÕve taken some time to reflect on the communication surrounding this matter Ñ not just in the
past few days, but throughout the entire process.
The meeting times proposed in your recent email were sent without any acknowledgement of my
previous proposal, no explanation for the lack of response to the 9:00 AM deadline I had clearly
stated, and no apology for the time and preparation that were disregarded when your office failed
to respond. That silence, in itself, said a great deal.
In addition, the questions I have raised Ñ including the breakdown of the $800 figure, the repair
timeline, and the specific conditions affecting my tenancy Ñ have still not been addressed in
writing. These are matters that should be readily available to your team, and I find it concerning
that they remain unanswered despite repeated and reasonable requests.
IÕve done my best to remain cooperative, flexible, and patient, even though I am the one living with
the ongoing impact. But based on the way this has been handled, I no longer believe that an inperson meeting will lead to any meaningful resolution Ñ especially when my time and concerns
have not been respected.
Accordingly, I will not be attending any further meetings. From this point forward, I will only
continue this matter through formal written communication. If that clarity is not provided, I will
proceed with the appropriate next steps without further notice.
I have made every effort to avoid escalation. If communication continues in this pattern, the matter
will simply follow its natural course.

Sincerely,

Chawakorn Kamnuansil

Dear Sylvia,

Thank you again for your recent update, and for forwarding the proposed rent adjustment of
$800.

As IÕve mentioned previously, IÕm still very open to resolving this matter directly and as fairly as
possible, given the nature and duration of the disruption.

Before I can respond to the proposed amount, IÕd really appreciate your clarification on a few
key points, just so thereÕs no confusion going forward:

¥
How exactly was the $800 figure calculated?
¥
What time period does it cover?

Re: Follow-up Ð Formal Demand & Statement Regarding Unresolved Repairs (Unit 1803)

Does it reflect one tenant or both of us?
¥
If accepted, would that payment mean I canÕt raise other issues like earlier disruption or
temporary accommodation?
¥
And whatÕs the current expected repair timeline?

From my side, IÕve been looking at the impact from around 15 April, which is when the issue
started and when I first reached out. So I hope that context can be considered as part of your
teamÕs preparation before we meet. It would really help if everything could be brought or
explained clearly during the discussion, so we donÕt go in circles.

To keep things moving forward, IÕd like to propose an in-person meeting at your office on
Thursday, 12 June at 10:30 AM. IÕll be bringing a support person with me as well. Nothing
formal Ñ just someone to help me navigate things clearly.

If this time doesnÕt work for your team, please let me know by 9:00 AM Thursday. If I donÕt hear
back by then, IÕll assume the meeting canÕt go ahead as suggested and will take the next steps
from there.

Thank you again Ñ IÕm still hopeful we can bring this to a clear and fair resolution.

Kind regards,
Chawakorn Kamnuansil

Dear Chawakorn,
Thank you for your email and for clearly outlining your concerns. We completely
understand the frustration and inconvenience this ongoing issue has caused, and
we truly appreciate your patience.
Repair Timeline:
We have formally submitted your 30% rent reduction request to the Owners
Corporation and are awaiting their response. Once we receive their feedback, we
will provide you with a confirmed repair timeline and projected completion date.
Temporary Relocation:
As discussed, the affected bedroom will need to be vacant during the repair work,
including the installation of drying equipment.
Co-Tenant Impact:
We recognize that your co-tenant will also be affected by these repairs. Please
rest assured that we will keep both of you informed about the repair schedule and
any potential disruptions.
We fully respect your decision to withhold consent until these matters are fully
addressed in writing. We are working to resolve this as quickly as possible and will
provide all the necessary details as soon as they are available.
If you have any further questions or need additional clarification, please donÕt
hesitate to reach out.
Kind regards,

Sylvia Hao

Dear Sylvia,
Thank you for your response dated Friday, 6 June 2025 at 11:50am.
As the primary resident of the property who has lived through weeks of
unresolved water damage, I must reiterate that no one is more eager than I am
to see the situation resolved quickly and properly. However, I am currently
unable to provide consent for any repair work to begin.
Firstly, your email referred to repairs commencing on "Thursday, 6 June"a date
which had already passed at the time of your message. This inconsistency is not
just confusing; it is logistically impossible and calls into question the seriousness
of the repair planning. Such unclear and last-minute communication cannot form
the basis for valid consent.
Secondly, I must emphasise that I cannot authorise access until the following
points are clearly confirmed in writing:
1. A definitive and specific repair timeline, including projected completion date.
2. Whether temporary relocation will be required, and if so, what arrangements
or compensation are being offered.
3. Your position on my formal request for rent reduction and confirmation of nonliability, which remain outstanding.
4. Acknowledgment of the impact on my co-tenant, who is also named in the
lease agreement, and who will equally be affected by noise and accessibility
issues related to the drying equipment.
It is my responsibility to ensure that any agreement made does not inadvertently
waive our legal rights or create further hardship. I must act cautiously, especially
as the installation of industrial drying equipment operating 24/7 poses real
disturbancessomething your office acknowledged in our previous phone call.
If I were to consent now without these matters resolved in writing, it could later
be used to suggest that I accepted all resulting conditions, which I absolutely do
not.
Therefore, I will only provide access once I receive formal written confirmation
addressing all points above. Until then, I consider it unreasonable to demand a
commitment from me, especially under these unclear and one-sided
circumstances.
As noted in my formal demand, if a resolution is not reached within five (5)

Dear Chawakorn,
Thank you for your email and the supporting documents outlining your
concerns and formal request.
We understand the impact this situation has had on your tenancy and
appreciate the way youÕve approached the matter. We will now forward
your request and documentation to the Owners Corporation for
consideration of a rent compensation claim based on the current
circumstances.
In the meantime, we are aiming to proceed with the repair works as soon
as possible. Could you kindly confirm whether works can commence on
Thursday, 6 June 2025, or let us know your earliest availability to provide
access?
We will continue to keep you updated as we receive further information

Re: Follow-up Ð Formal Demand & Statement Regarding Unresolved Repairs (Unit 1803)

Dear Sylvia,

I am writing with the intent of resolving this matter constructively and
without escalation, if possible.

Over the past two months, I have reported the water damage issue
multiple times in good faith, cooperated with your office, and done my
best to remain in the property despite the difficulties. I am not trying to
be confrontational; I simply need a clear and reasonable outcome,
supported by appropriate action and communication.

Please find attached:

1.
A formal demand letter outlining my request for rent compensation, a
firm repair timeline, and confirmation of non-liability Ð based on my
rights under the Residential Tenancies Act 1997 (VIC).
2.
A supporting tenant statement summarising the verbal communication
with your office around 2Ð3 June 2025, including the temporary
accommodation proposal and its impractical conditions.

If a fair and written resolution is not reached within five (5) business
days, I will have no choice but to initiate proceedings through VCAT. I
sincerely hope this can be avoided and that we can achieve a reasonable
solution for all parties involved.

I would appreciate your written response at your earliest convenience.

Kind regards,
Chawakorn Kamnuansil
