Dear Jamie Ong,
VCAT has dismissed the possession application in R202518589/00. I propose the following to
conclude this matter e ciently.
Proposed Terms
¥ Compensation: AUD 10,000 lump sum, payable by bank transfer (details on acceptance).
¥ Rent freeze: Rent Þxed at $2,825/month for 24 months from the acceptance date.

◦ Within 7 days of acceptance, conÞrm in writing that:
◦ Sylvia Hao and Johnson Tan will no longer be involved.
◦ Appropriate internal actions have been taken.
◦ Documentary conÞrmation will be provided.
¥ Bond: Maintain/return in full with no deductions.
¥ Authority & escalation: See Leverage & Enforcement for authority and escalation
requirements.
Leverage & Enforcement
¥ Time of the essence: O er expires 23 August 2025, 17:00 AEST.
¥ Without prejudice Ñ save as to costs: This correspondence may be relied upon as to costs.
¥ Authority warranty: The signatory warrants authority to bind the agency and rental
provider. If authority is limited, escalate to the OIEC/Principal and conÞrm within 7 days.
¥ No re-Þling: Following acceptance, no further possession action will be taken on the same
facts or grounds as R202518589/00.

Johnson Tan are removed from any involvement. ConÞrm Þle annotations and handover.

Victoria (EARS) and the Business Licensing Authority, and (iii) where applicable, a
complaint to the Victorian Ombudsman.
¥ ConÞdentiality: Settlement terms to be recorded in a VCAT consent order or deed;
conÞdentiality to the extent permitted by law.
If accepted, these terms will constitute a full and Þnal settlement of the issues raised to date. I
will ask VCAT to issue a consent order or strike out the case with a right to apply for
reinstatement to ensure enforceability.
Financial Breakdown
Rent reduction baseline: 30% × $2,825 × ~4 months (16 AprÐ14 Aug = 120 days) = $3,390.00
VCAT fee paid: $74.10
Post-order rolling abatement (from 15 Aug): $27.85/day* until repair completion & handover
*Calculation: (2,825 × 12 × 30%) / 365 ≈ $27.85/day.
Payment On acceptance, request my EFT details by emailing ck.chawakorn@gmail.com. Cheque
or PayID is also acceptable.
