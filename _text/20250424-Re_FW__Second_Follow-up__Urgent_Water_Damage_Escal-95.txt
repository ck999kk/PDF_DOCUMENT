Hi Chawakorn,
Thank you for your follow-up, and IÕm sorry for the continued inconvenience youÕve been
experiencing.
Under the ownerÕs instructions, weÕve managed to arrange for the Owners Corporation to
inspect the roof next week, after multiple attempts. WeÕll be sure to keep you updated as
soon as we have further information from them.
Additionally, we will notify the Owners Corporation about the water ingress into the
carpet and the ongoing damage.
WeÕve also updated your contact number on our end to ensure we have the correct
details moving forward.
We truly appreciate your patience, and weÕre working to resolve this as quickly as
possible.
Kind regards,

Sylvia Hao

Subject: Second Follow-up: Urgent Water Damage Escalation Ð Immediate Action Required
(Unit 1803)

Dear Sylvia,

I hope you are doing well.

IÕm writing again to follow up on the urgent water leakage issue in my unit (1803, 243
Franklin Street), which I first reported prior to the Easter holiday.

At the time, I was advised that this would be treated as a priority and was also provided
with a contact list for emergency tradespeople. In accordance with that advice, I
reached out to Flood Response as listed. Unfortunately, they replied stating that they
were closed on Easter Monday and unable to attend. IÕve attached a screenshot of their
message for reference.

Since then, I have not received any updates or confirmation regarding the next steps,
even though the holiday period has now ended. Meanwhile, the situation has continued
to worsen.

Attached are the most recent photos taken today, clearly showing the ceiling stains
spreading further, severe wall swelling, and visible water marks continuing to develop.
More critically, as the flooring in my room is carpeted, water has now begun to soak into
the carpet, creating both dampness and a persistent musty odour.

This is no longer just a structural concern Ñ it now directly affects my personal living
conditions and health. The continued moisture increases the risk of mould developing
beneath the carpet, which could pose serious health risks and result in more extensive
damage if not addressed immediately.

IÕve followed every step requested and have been as patient as possible. However, at
this stage, I must insist on urgent action. I trust that I will not be held responsible for
any resulting damages, especially given that I have reported the issue early and
complied with all procedures.

Please confirm when a professional will attend the property to inspect and begin repairs.
IÕd truly appreciate your prompt attention and resolution to this matter.

Also, if possible, could you please update my contact details to ensure youÕre using my
current number: 0449 962 645.
For the previous issue regarding the bed, I suspect there may have been an attempt to
reach me on an outdated number.

Kind regards,
Chawakorn Kamnuansil
