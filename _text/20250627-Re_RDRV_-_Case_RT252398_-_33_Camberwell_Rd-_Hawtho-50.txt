Good afternoon Chawakorn
Thank you for your email. I understand your application relates to urgent repairs and
compensation.
The urgent repair component must be dealt with Þrst as it is considered more urgent. If this
matter progressed to a VCAT hearing only the urgent repairs would be considered in a Þrst
hearing.
As a resolution appears to have been reached regarding the repairs component I will proceed to
strike this matter out with a right of reinstatement.
What this means is if you wish to proceed with a compensation claim this would be dealt with at a
later date. To do this you would request to reinstate your case using the attached form if the
repairs were not completed as agreed or if you wish to pursue compensation once the repairs are
completed.
If you wish to obtain legal advice or information you may wish to reach out to Tenants Victoria
https://tenantsvic.org.au/
Please let me know if you have any questions.

Regards,

Matthew T.

Dear Matthew,
I just received your email about closing my case and I'm quite confused. I thought getting a repair date was just the
beginning of solving my problems, not the end.
**The key issues I still need help with are:**
- Compensation for 70+ days of paying full rent for an unusable bedroom
- Where to stay during repairs (the agency hasn't provided any solution for this yet)
- This has now affected my studies - my college contacted me this week about urgent matters
**I don't understand - does getting a repair date mean I can't ask about these other problems anymore?**
Thank you so much for arranging the July 7th repair after you contacted them. It's amazing they could suddenly arrange
it after saying they needed 6-7 business days when I was asking, and I'd already waited over two months.
I also wanted to mention that I haven't been able to conÞrm access for the repairs yet because the agency hasn't
answered any of my previous questions about what exactly will happen during the repairs or what solutions they'll
provide. From what I understand, my ßatmate and I will need to leave our rooms during the work, which is quite a big
decision that affects both our daily lives directly. I don't think it makes sense for me to conÞrm anything when I haven't
received any information about the details or arrangements.
I'm very sorry if I'm completely misunderstanding how this process works. As an international student who has never
dealt with anything like this before, I realize I probably don't understand what VCAT can and cannot help with. I was
hoping you might be able to guide me about what's reasonable to expect, but I understand if I'm asking for things that
aren't part of your role.
Should I just accept whatever happens with the repairs and forget about the past 70+ days and other problems? I don't
want to cause trouble, but it doesn't feel right to just forget everything that happened.
I'm quite overwhelmed and honestly don't know what to do about the compensation and accommodation issues. Could
you please help me understand if there are options to address these concerns even if the repairs get scheduled?
I hope it's okay to communicate in writing as phone conversations are difÞcult for me with serious matters. I don't have
friends or family here who understand these problems, so I'm trying to Þgure everything out alone.
Thank you for your patience with me.
Thank you,
Chawakorn Kamnuansil

Hi Matthew,
Thank you for your email.
I have spoken with them yesterday morning and they have advised that due to their tight schedule, they will have to
look into their booking and let us know when is the next available date.
The contractor advised that the next available date should be within the next 6-7 business days.
Since I havenÕt received any conÞrmation, I have just sent another email to the OC and the contractor, asking them to
provide a date & time.
I will let you know once I have heard back from them.
Thank you.

Good afternoon Johnson
Can you please conÞrm whether you are able to conÞrm a time that trades will be able to reattend the property. Could
you please conÞrm this by close of business today.
If not I will need to progress this matter to a hearing due to timeframes required to list urgent repair applications.
If an agreement can be reached regarding a timeframe to resolve the repair issue this matter can be struck out with a
right of reinstatement. I have included the renters in this email for reference.

Matthew T.
