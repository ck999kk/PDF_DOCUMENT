Application under Residential Tenancies Act 1997 challenging validity of notice to vacate - residential
Section 91ZZS
______________________________________________________________________________________
VCAT finds:
1.

The applicants have filed an application under section 91ZZS of the Residential Tenancies Act 1997
challenging the validity of a notice to vacate.

2.

The notice to vacate in question was given to the renter under section 91ZL of the Residential
Tenancies Act 1997.

3.

Section 91ZZS of the Residential Tenancies Act 1997 specifies that a renter may apply to challenge
the validity of a notice to vacate given under section 91ZX , 91ZY, 91ZZ, 91ZZA, 91ZZB or 91ZZC.
It does not allow a renter to challenge the validity of a notice to vacate given under section 91ZL.

4.

Pursuant to section 75 of the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal Act 1998, the Tribunal has
formed the view on the material before it, that the application is misconceived.

5.

The renters cannot preemptively challenge the notice to vacate. However, the renters can still
challenge the validity of the notice to vacate under section 91ZZI of the Act if the residential
rental provider applies for a possession order on the basis of the 91ZL notice to vacate
issued on 11 July 2025.

6.

The Tribunal notes that if the parties can agree on an arrangement for the renters to move
out for about 14 days, the repairs could be completed and the renters could return to the
premises.

VCAT orders:
1.

The application is struck out with a right to apply for reinstatement.

Note:

If the applicants apply for reinstatement they must provide details of why the strike out order is
opposed, including a response to the findings made by the Tribunal above.
