Dear Sylvia,

Thank you for your email.

I conÞrm that access to the bedroom can be provided as required to facilitate the scheduled repairs. I will
ensure that personal items are removed in time.

However, I must formally note that the water intrusion, plaster damage, and associated issues have been
ongoing since approximately 15 April 2025. I submitted multiple written reports, yet no action was taken
to mitigate the impact for several weeks. This has resulted in substantial disruption and compromised my
ability to safely and reasonably occupy the premises.

Given this, I request that your o ce assess and propose an appropriate rent reduction or compensation,
in line with the responsibilities of the rental provider under the Residential Tenancies Act 1997 (VIC). The
current circumstances reßect a clear breach of my right to quiet enjoyment, as well as your obligation to
attend to urgent repairs in a timely manner.

I also wish to express concern regarding the proposed solution that I relocate for the duration of repairs
without any logistical or Þnancial support. It is not reasonable to expect me to independently secure
alternative accommodation within a constrained budget. The responsibility for this situation does not rest
with me, and I cannot be expected to bear its consequences. Furthermore, while I appreciate the ownerÕs
o er to stay at their Mount Waverley residence, I must respectfully decline. My daily activities, work, and
personal needs are based in the city, and any temporary solution must reßect the realities of my lifestyle
and commitments.

I will cooperate within reason, but I ask that the proposed solution be revisited in good faith to ensure it
does not transfer the burden to me for a matter caused by delays in your agencyÕs response.

Please also note that I will not accept any further contact by telephone. All future communication must be
conducted via email only to avoid disruption to my work and to maintain a written record.

If no compensation or reasonable resolution is o ered within Þve business days, I will consider escalating
the matter by submitting a formal application to the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal (VCAT). I
remain open to resolving this amicably, but the solution must be fair, timely, and consistent with the facts
of the situation.

Kind regards,

As discussed, there is potential mould growth and further damage to the carpet and plaster in
the affected bedroom. The building strata and property owners are actively pursuing
remediation works to prevent further deterioration.
To move forward, we kindly ask for your confirmation regarding access to the bedroom so that

Please confirm at your earliest convenience.

Hi Charwakorn,
Just a quick updateÑOC contractor has confirmed that one of the affected rooms will
need to remain inaccessible during the drying process. Drying equipment will be placed
in that bedroom, and please note it does emit a moderate level of noise and
unfortunately cannot be switched off during operation.
If you prefer not to move out during this period, you're welcome to share the second
bedroom or use the living area as a temporary alternative. Could you please confirm if

Hi Chawakorn,
Thank you for your detailed update and the photo.
IÕve followed up with the Owners Corporation to confirm that the leak has been
resolved, and IÕve requested that the necessary rectification works be arranged
without further delay. IÕve also asked them to provide a clear timeline for
inspection and repairs.
I understand the inconvenience this has caused and appreciate your continued
patience. IÕll keep you updated as soon as I receive a confirmed plan from their
side.
Best regards,

Sylvia Hao

Hi Sylvia,

Thanks for your reply. HereÕs an update on the wall Ñ although the water has
dried, there is still a visible stain and surface warping, as shown in the attached
photo.

IÕve done my best to manage it temporarily using Gumption, but this is clearly
not a long-term solution and shouldnÕt fall under the tenantÕs responsibility.

The wall is still visibly damaged and the room remains unsuitable for normal use.
I need to know when someone will be sent to inspect and repair the affected
area. This needs to be addressed properly, not just acknowledged.

Also, for record-keeping purposes, all communication regarding this matter must
be done via email, as phone calls cannot be documented as evidence if needed.

I expect a response with a clear action plan and timeline.

Best regards,
Chawakorn

The plumber who attended the unit last Wednesday was arranged by the OwnerÕs

Corporation to address the leak from the hot water system. We are currently waiting
on their formal report to conÞrm that the issue has been fully resolved.

In the meantime, could you please let me know if there has been any further water
ingress or signs of dampness since their visit? This will help ensure there are no
ongoing issues.

Once we receive conÞrmation that the source of the leak is no longer active, we will
arrange for quotations to repair the internal damage, including the wall and
potentially a ected carpet and underlay.

I understand how frustrating this situation is and will continue to follow up with the
relevant parties to ensure the matter is addressed appropriately.
