Tenant Statement of Verbal Communications and Delayed Repairs

I, Chawakorn Kamnuansil, tenant of Unit 1803 at 243 Franklin Street, Melbourne VIC, provide this
statement in relation to a phone call I received from the managing agent (Areal Property) around 2-3
June 2025, and the ongoing failure to rectify serious water damage in my unit.

1. During the call, I was informed that a dehumidifier would be installed in the damaged bedroom,
and that it would emit continuous noise and operate 24/7. I was advised that it would be better for
me and my roommate to temporarily vacate the property.

2. I was asked whether I could stay with nearby friends or relatives. I replied that I could not and
would not, because it is not my responsibility to resolve a crisis created by agency inaction. I also
noted that the agency had not provided any alternative accommodation options.

3. The agency stated that if I were to seek temporary accommodation, it would only be reimbursed if
the cost did not exceed the current rent ($2,825/month). This is impractical-my roommate and I are
not in a personal relationship and cannot share a single room. Finding two separate rooms for a
short-term stay in Melbourne under $700/week is not realistic.

4. I acknowledged that the landlord had offered temporary accommodation at a residence in Mount
Waverley, but I declined. My life and work are based in the city, and relocation would severely
impact my routine. I asked if other options existed. The agent replied that the "final option" would be
for me to terminate the lease early.

5. I made it clear that I would not terminate the lease. I have taken exceptional care of the property. I
clean regularly, report issues promptly, and had no part in causing this damage. The water intrusion
was first reported in mid-April. Had repairs been actioned swiftly, the situation would not have

escalated to the current level.

6. I lived through the consequences-damp smells, wall stains, an unusable bedroom-without any
real assistance. I feared undertaking repairs myself in case I became liable. I used air purifiers and
candles daily just to remain inside the apartment.

7. Two months later, no significant progress has been made. I am now being pressured with
unsuitable options. I respectfully ask why no urgency was shown when I first raised this matter. Had
action been taken earlier, extensive damage could have been avoided.

This statement is true to the best of my knowledge and made in good faith.

Signed,
Chawakorn Kamnuansil
